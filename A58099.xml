            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

                  <p>
                     <seg rend="decorInit">I</seg>F there were not a great dimneſſe in our ſight, and dulneſſe in the under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding of our judgements, (which ſhould ordinarily be led by reaſon, more than by received opinions,) there is no doubt, but all things would goe far better, and in a high<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er way, yea whole Nations would be truely honora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, glorious, magnificent, rich, mighty, powerfull, and redoubtable unto their enemies, ſpread more large, enjoy far more Kingdomes, then now they poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſſe ſhires, governe them with more facility and leſſe trouble, then now a handfull of Cities. The lack of true noble principles ſpoyles all great affaires. Nothing is eaſie, becauſe we are childiſh in our actions. Let us lay a good foundation, and upon a little ground we may e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rect an excellent, high and glorious ſteeple, which will be ſeen far abroad. It is not money that gives ſplen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dor to the world, but reaſon. The ſunne is that which carries the braveſt ſway in the world, diſcovering all things, ſeeing all things of any colour, nature and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition,
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:64385:14"/>good or bad. And in that vaſtnes of the heaven it occupies but a little ſpace, yet gives light and glory unto the whole Hemiſphere; The reaſon with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>us man-kinde, is the ſunne of our judgement, whereby we are able to learne all things quickly and eaſily, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe thereby wee can comprehend all things taught us. Let there be never ſo many actions, it will eaſily diſcerne them all. Never ſo voluminous workes, it will leade us through them, and make way even in the darkeſt paſſages of them, and ſhew us what method it had by the author, when he pen'd the booke, and that it is the ſame ſun both for his &amp; our Hemiſphere, like as we know, that the ſunne is the ſame to them at <hi>Jeruſalem</hi> (and al other parts of the world,) that it is to us in <hi>England.</hi> If then theſe things, that come under our eyes, are ſo certaine, why ſhould the eyes of our judgement bee ſo dimſighted, as not to diſcerne by reaſon ſuch things, as are onely to bee made eaſie and delightſome unto us therby, except we delight more in ignorance then knowledge. Yet that can never be ſaid of mankind, whereſoever or whatſoever, but muſt ſtill be granted, that indeed it doth rather imbrace (ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to that light of Nature which God hath be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtowed upon it) REASON than UNREASON, LIGHT than DARKENES, LOVE then HATRED. And thence it comes to paſſe that yet ſo many things are done, becauſe reaſon leades us on, ſhewes us the hope to come through, the waies wherby to endeavour how to ſhunne the ſnares, to avoid the enemies, to imbrace the friends, and to improve all to the beſt advantage, &amp; thus to come at our journeys end. Only we confeſſe, that this Honorable Councellor within us, given by God Almighty, is never, or very ſeldome heard by the greateſt part of men (not out of hatred but ſlowneſſe of ſpirit, &amp; unwillingneſſe of paines, unthankefullnes after having received good counſell,) but rather ſubdued
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:64385:14"/>or oppreſſed by vices, lewdnes, corruption or malice, to the great hurt and griefe of this our ſunne. This neg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lect of reaſon hath troubled and made all Learnings uneaſie, becauſe without it wee have them all given to us without life. Reaſon is the life of all actions, of all learnings. And thence it is, that the Mathematicks are the moſt true and delightfull ſtudies, becauſe the fulleſt of reaſon. And where that layes the ground<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>worke, the fabrick will bee durable. Thus all Lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guages (when they are taught or learned by and with reaſon,) have an excellent eaſineſſe, and that is the cauſe why people generally beleeve, that in Heaven they ſhall ſpeak ſome other than their mother tongue, and yet attaine to it without the leaſt difficulty, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe reaſon will make any tongue eaſier than a thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand rules. The principles of all tongues are laid by reaſon, as well as the principles of Phyſick, Metaphy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſick, Logick, or any other Art whatſoever. But our opinions and principles not being regulated thereby, doe invert all the waies to learne them, to a difficulty. Whence it comes to paſſe, that even al people cry out, Tongues are difficult, and lay that downe as a certaine principle. If now people build upon ſuch ground, can we expect any thing from them but fooliſh talk<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and writings. Can we finde figs on thornes, or grapes on thiſtles, or is it poſſible for the fruit to bee ſweet, where the very root of the tree is bitternes it ſelfe. Let us then lay aſide, (and that with your leave) all ſuch principles, and imbrace this viz. <hi>That Tongues are the eaſieſt things in the world to learne and that with great delight.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>To come then neerer to our Tongues, the ſubject of this our preſent diſcourſe, I confeſſe that ſtill I find among all men (nay the learned themſelves) many ſtrange opinions of them, and ſuch principles, that if they ſhould be truely ſcanned, they would make the
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:64385:15"/>world to laugh at them. The neareſt way that I am able to ſhew, to ſpeake and judge truely of theſe Tongues. <hi>viz. Ebrew, Calde, Samaritan, Syriac, Ara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bic</hi> and <hi>Ethiopic,</hi> is onely that you believe all things on the contrary. If they tell you, <hi>there are many;</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve them to be but one, If, <hi>hard to be gotten;</hi> to be eaſie. If, <hi>without uſe;</hi> there are none more uſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full. If, <hi>of a hard pronunciation;</hi> not much harder than Engliſh. <hi>
                        <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ngracious;</hi> the ſweeteſt expreſſions in Engliſh are found in them. <hi>Not many Bookes in them,</hi> More than any man is able to read through in all his life time. <hi>Of no comely Characters,</hi> as neate as Engliſh. <hi>Of few words,</hi> And the more wiſe, grave, ſerious, majeſtaticall ſpeeches. <hi>Contemptible,</hi> by none but ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norant and malicious men. <hi>They are loſt,</hi> no more than the German, French, Italian, Spaniſh, Latine, or the Engliſh. <hi>No good Authors extant in them.</hi> The Bible is originally in this tongue. And if you can forget or ſlightly paſſe by that booke, which the ſpirit of God himſelfe hath penned, and ſent into your boſome, you are not worthy to look on any book elſe, although I would have ſhewed you onely in <hi>England</hi> about two thouſand. <hi>None is honoured by learning them.</hi> True, becauſe none did truely un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtand them, <hi>No people ſtudied them.</hi> Yet all nati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons do. <hi>The <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>niverſities drive more the Arts, than theſe Tongues.</hi> Becauſe they were taught to be many, and learned men would rather diſpute, than become ſchollars againe and againe.</p>
                  <p>Yet all this ſpoken in an oppoſite way is eaſily done and ſaid, but not eaſily believed, becauſe the old principles are ſo deeply rooted in mens hearts, therefore is it fit to go on a litle more plainely in the declaration of their nature, then in railing and wrangling about them. Wherefore I will chooſe to ſpeake <hi>firſt</hi> of their Antiquitie; <hi>ſecondly,</hi> of their rare
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:64385:15"/>vertues; <hi>thirdly,</hi> of their largeneſſe; <hi>fourthly,</hi> of their uſe; <hi>fiftly,</hi> of their unity, <hi>ſixthly and laſtly,</hi> of their eaſines. And all this without much premeditati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, but onely as few dayes labour of uſing the pen will afford: their being many reaſons in the way, why I could not ſpend great labour or much time about this buſineſſe at this inſtant.</p>
                  <p>And <hi>firſt,</hi> the Antiquity of them is granted by all, to be before any of the <hi>European Tongues</hi> whatſoever. But the <hi>Greeke</hi> Tongue, which ſpread ſo ſarre in <hi>Europe,</hi> that out of <hi>Greece</hi> it took root in <hi>Spaine, France, Italie,</hi> and in <hi>Affrica</hi> in all the mediterra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nean Seaſhore, and almoſt into <hi>Perſia</hi> it ſelfe by <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lexander</hi> the Great (not that it was the onely tongue ſpoken in <hi>Aſia, Africa,</hi> and <hi>Europe,</hi> all other Tongues being loſt, but that it came in for its ſmoothneſſe, by the victoriouſneſſe of that people, and the acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vity of their Kings, and great traffick of their moſt renouned Merchants and ſea-men.) this <hi>Greeke</hi> Tongue onely might challenge a great Antiquity, and be competitor with <hi>Calde, Syriac, Samaritan,</hi> and <hi>Arabic,</hi> if not with <hi>Ethiopic,</hi> whereof we are like to know almoſt nothing (with <hi>Ebrew</hi> no man dare bring it into competition for antiquity;) but if diverſity of names make no diſtinct matter, and if the eſſence be not divers, becauſe it has many accidents, and if the ſubſtance of any thing be remaining the ſame in num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber, although you add never ſo many outward pictures and titles, gloſſes and inſcriptions, and if the thing it ſelfe be not changed, in changing the outſide one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, and if a man remaine the very ſame, although he ſhould be ſo fooliſh, as to change his habit every day and never weare the ſame cloaths two dayes together, than let us not deſpaire, (if we can make it appeare, that <hi>Ebrew, Calde, Samaritan, Syriac, Arabic</hi> and <hi>E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiopic</hi> are but one and the ſame language, as we ſhall in
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:64385:16"/>the fifth part) but that the argument uſed for the anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quity of <hi>Ebrew</hi> will ſhew the very ſame antiquity to be in all the ſaid Tongues, becauſe they being all one, began at one inſtant together with <hi>Adam,</hi> given unto him by God Almighty, to talke with his Creator and afterward with his bedfellow, not with the Divel as ſhe did. Beſides, wee know there was a great diſtance between the <hi>Caldean</hi> Empire, the <hi>Syrian</hi> Gods, the <hi>Arabian</hi> Rovery, and the <hi>Grecian</hi> ſetlement and well grounded aſſurance, or full large extent ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther of the tongue or government, we know further, that the whole <hi>Greeke</hi> Tongue (no dialect excepted) as big as it now is,) comes by good naturall pedegree from the <hi>Ebrew, Calde, Samaritan, Syriac, Arabic,</hi> and I dare ſay as much out of <hi>Ethiopic.</hi> I ſay not only from <hi>Ebrew,</hi> and though a great quantity of <hi>Greek</hi> be already derived by divers Authors only from the <hi>E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brew</hi> Bible words: (ſo that if I am not miſtaken, there are above ſixe thouſand <hi>Greeke</hi> words clearely deri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved by divers learned Authors from thence, as a ſon deſcending from his parents) yet if the very ſame root and ſtock be in the <hi>Calde, Samaritan, Syriac, Arabie</hi> and <hi>Ethiopic</hi> Tongue, who can deny (or will not eaſily grant) that all theſe ſix thouſand <hi>Greeke</hi> words already derived out of <hi>Ebrew,</hi> are at the ſame inſtant derived out of <hi>Calde,</hi> &amp;c. And than beſides, if many thouſand words extant in <hi>Greek</hi> can (either by me or many hundred men) be further derived from theſe <hi>Ebrew</hi> words extant in the Bible, wil not all this declare more and more a great antiquity not onely of <hi>Ebrew</hi> I ſay, but alſo of <hi>Calde, Samaritan, Syriac, Arabic and Ethiopic</hi> before the <hi>Greeke</hi> Tongue, it be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing a moſt reaſonable principle, that if the parents beget never ſo many children in divers Countryes, let theſe children have never ſo many and various names, yet they wil never be elder than their parents.
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:64385:16"/>Further as it would be a ſinple aſſertion, that whatſoe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver word is not extant in the Engliſh Bible, is not Engliſh, even ſo and no leſſe ridiculous doe almoſt all the learned men hetherto ſpeake, when they ſay, that whatſoever word they finde not in the <hi>Ebrew</hi> Bibel, is not any more <hi>Ebrew,</hi> and therefore then it muſt be called <hi>Calde;</hi> if they finde it in the <hi>Calde</hi> Jewiſh tranſlation upon the old Teſtament; or <hi>Sy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riac,</hi> if in a <hi>Syrian</hi> Authour, or <hi>Arabic,</hi> by an <hi>Ara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bian,</hi> and <hi>Ethiopic</hi> by an <hi>Ethiopian,</hi> or <hi>Samaritic,</hi> in the <hi>Samaritan</hi> character of the <hi>Ebrew</hi> five Bookes of <hi>Meſes,</hi> in ſome paſſages differing from the <hi>Ebrew</hi> Bibles extant, or in their <hi>Paraphraſe</hi> upon the text. This as it is unſound, and a ſport of dark mindes, led out of the way by neglects of their owne learning, ſo ſhall it be declared in the fifth point. And therefore as we grant that there are ſome words ſound in <hi>Calde Syriac,</hi> and <hi>Arabic</hi> books, which are not in the <hi>Ebrew</hi> Bible, and beſides as we know, that even of them alſo a great quantity of Greek words are derived by ſome, and yet many hundred more will heareafter be derived; all this doth ſhew, that the <hi>Greeke</hi> tongue can not come into competition for antiquity, either with <hi>Ebrew, Calde, Syriac, Arabic,</hi> or <hi>Ethiopic,</hi> Neither is that dreame, as if the <hi>Greeke</hi> tongue had bin hatched at the ſame inſtant with <hi>Calde, Samari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tan, Syriac, Arabic,</hi> and <hi>Ethiopic</hi> (conceaved to be ſo many divers Tongues) at the confuſion of Babel, that dreame I ſay is not with any reaſon, but onely a blinde talke upon ſuppoſitions. Firſt, <hi>Of a confuſion of Tongues</hi> in the plurall, where the Scripture clear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ſpeaks onely of one tongue, of one pronuntiation, which tongue was confounded, I grant it, but as the Scripture ſaith, not unto many tongues, (for ſo it ſaith not) but many pronunciations of the very ſelfe ſame tongue, and ſo much it ſayes, and that is true.
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:64385:17"/>Which was enough to diſperſetheſe builders, when they could not underſtand one the others pronunciation, although they ſpake the ſame language. As forinſtance, notwithſtanding <hi>Engliſh, Scotiſh, Daniſh, Swediſh, Nor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wagiſh, Greenlandiſh, Low Dutch,</hi> and the High <hi>German</hi> tongue is but one tongue all in all, with many (yet ſmall) accidentall differences, theſe ſaid nations can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not underſtand one another at an inſtant and new un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>expected meeting, (I ſay not of the neareſt but moſt remoted nations,) becauſe of the divers pronun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciations of Conſonants and Vowels together with the diſplacing of the accent. Secondly. <hi>Of an immediate pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ereation of many tongues (innumber ſeventy two.)</hi> Which old fable hath bin among the <hi>Greek</hi> fathers, by name in <hi>Epiphanius</hi> his book of foureſcore ſects, (he lived in the time of <hi>Baſil, Gregory, Chriſoſtom,</hi> &amp; <hi>Hie rome</hi>) from thence among the Latines <hi>Hierome</hi> and <hi>Auguſtine,</hi> but before theſe the <hi>Syrians</hi> and <hi>Arabians</hi> in <hi>Orient,</hi> and the reſt of the <hi>Heathen, Jewes</hi> and <hi>Chriſtians,</hi> did after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward diſperſe it among the <hi>Turkes</hi> &amp; all other religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons and ſorts of people, and runnes at this day currant through the whole world. But concerning this matter, theſe things are certaine, that there was but one and not many tongues, and that that one tongue was devi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded by the diverſity of the lips or pronunciation: and then, that every particular perſon had not a ſeverall language, nor a ſeverall pronunciation, for then there could have bin no ſociety after the diſperſion; but that whole families only had their proper pronuncia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion; therfore certaine is that alſo, that neither ſeventy two Languages, or more or leſſe, took then beginning, neither every particular language now uſed was then founded, but onely the Mother and Originall tongue, which we now have under hand, nor that beſides this primitive tongue other mother &amp; original tongues now uſed or exſtinguiſhed, were then founded, out of which
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:64385:17"/>thers ſhould ſince have bin derived, as many learned think. To what purpoſe, I beſeech you, at the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſion of Babell was the Engliſh tongue, when there was not yet any Engliſh man, at leſt not <hi>Horſus</hi> and <hi>Hengiſtus?</hi> then we might ſay with more true reaſon, that the <hi>Low Dutch</hi> men were at that time, becauſe in Latine they are called <hi>Belgae,</hi> which they may ſay, comes from <hi>Peleg,</hi> at whoſe time this con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſion of Babell was, and he therefore called <hi>Pelga</hi> for <hi>Belga,</hi> p. for b. But as theſe are but fancies, ſo in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed is it no leſſe a fancy, when it is ſo confidently aſſerted of the <hi>Greek</hi> tongue. What property is there in it, that it ſhould have bin at the ſame time with <hi>Ebrew, Calde, Samaritan, Syriac, Arabic</hi> and <hi>Ethiopic,</hi> at the confuſion of Babell and not <hi>Engliſh.</hi> And where have you read the names of theſe 72. tongues, that did then bud out of that mudd? Tis true, that ſome Moderne writers on this point have followed and did believe <hi>Arnobius,</hi> (that <hi>Africane Heatheniſh Philoſopher,</hi> and profeſſor of <hi>Rhetoric,</hi> who was after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward a Chriſtian and a Miniſter of the word of God, he lived about three hundred yeares after the nativity of our Lord:) who upon the 105. Pſalme the 8. ver. <hi>(He hath remembred his covenant for ever, the word which he commanded to a thouſand generations,)</hi> conceives, that there are in the world (beſides a thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand (<hi>nations</hi> miſtaken for generations,) 72. tongues, to wit beyond <hi>Perſia</hi> Eaſtwards 406. nations, onely 27. tongues: on this ſide <hi>Perſia,</hi> all <hi>Aſta</hi> and <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>frica</hi> 394, nations, onely 22. tongues; and all <hi>Eu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rope,</hi> with the North of <hi>Aſia,</hi> Eaſtwards 200 nations, 23. tongues. Wherein partly we finde a very great au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dacity, or confidence as well in the number of nations, as tongues, yet a greater defect of the proper names of theſe 72. tongues, and withall a farre more un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reaſonable aſſertion, that <hi>Jafets</hi> 200. families or na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:64385:18"/>ſhould yeeld almoſt as many tongues in <hi>Europe,</hi> as <hi>Sem's</hi> 406. in <hi>Aſia,</hi> and more than <hi>Chams</hi> 394. in <hi>Africa;</hi> The reaſon, why to <hi>Europe</hi> he attributes 23. tongues, and but 200 nations to <hi>Africa</hi> 22. to <hi>Aſia</hi> 27. &amp; yet 800. nations is becauſe <hi>Arnobius</hi> deſcending from Roman Parents knew better the tradition of the <hi>Greec</hi> and <hi>Latine</hi> Fathers, than the tongues of <hi>Africa,</hi> underſtanding onely the <hi>Roman,</hi> and unacquainted with the <hi>Hebrew</hi> &amp;c., or at leaſt not thoroughly with one tongue of <hi>Africa,</hi> leſſe of <hi>Aſia.</hi> And yet upon ſuch rotten buildings, ſome moderne Authours (ſpeaking of tongues (and of thoſe which they doe not under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand,) moſt confidently) tell it as a certaine thing, that in the conſuſion of Babell there were 72. Languages devided. If than theſe 72. tongues are not named by this moſt confident <hi>Roman,</hi> or <hi>Moore,</hi> may ye not as well name the Engliſh, as the Greek. I ſee nothing in it, but only that we are conſident to tell tales far of, where we thinke no body can inquire whereas in things at home we are more ſparing, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe we may be eaſily intrapped, and more cauti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous in beleeving, becauſe we may diſcerne them for the moſt part by our reaſon, without inquiry; as for inſtance. Let us but conſider that tongues are onely made for man, not for beaſts or any other creature, were there at the confuſion of Babel onely 72. ſoules? for from ſo many perſons numbred, as they will take it in the tenth chapter of <hi>Geneſis,</hi> they derive 72. tongues; which yet cannot be true, thoſe 72. ſoules not being all, nor the onely builders of that Tower of Babel. And if many thouſands, which is more true and probable, why onely 72. tongues, when every one muſt needs have his owne tongue and pronunciation if he ſhall not be able to underſtand another; or if a thouſand men (after the confuſion of Babel) had one pronunciation different from an other thouſand, then
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:64385:18"/>partly this confuſion of pronunciations (where one could not underſtand another) was onely temporary, for the purpoſe of diſperſing thoſe, who againſt Gods will would live together in one City, and not diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perſe themſelves: partly no neceſſity of faigning and coyning tongues, and that ſo many at one inſtant, and that to dure till this day, and yet many families and nations periſhing, and others ariſing, this number of 72. tongues to have remained till this day, when ſome of thoſe 1000. Nations, whereof he conceives <hi>David</hi> to ſpeake, are now utterly periſhed, and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroyed. Nay notwithſtanding that a Catalogue of thouſand nations which are utterly loſt and periſhed, by me could eaſily be brought forth out of ancient Authours, yet till this very day 72. tongues to remain, and none to be loſt: from theſe, and many ſuch con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiderations I ſay it would be eaſily diſcovered to be a meere fable. And if you object, that even I con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſe, <hi>Ebrew, Calde, Samaritan, Syriac, Arabic</hi> and <hi>Ethiopic</hi> tongues to have bin there, I hope you are not ſo forgetfull, as not to remember that I promi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed to ſhew you hereafter the unity of thoſe tongues, and that it is no more many tongues (notwithſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing that it hath diverſity of titles and names) then the Grand Signiour of Conſtantinople many men, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe of his numerous high and lofty titles, or the King of <hi>Spaine</hi> many Kings, when he gave himſelfe a whole page of Titles of Kingdomes, and other ſmall places in <hi>Arabia</hi> and <hi>Eaſt Indies</hi> in his letter to the King of <hi>France.</hi> And as the King of <hi>France</hi> did more wiſe in my ſimple apprehenſion in giving un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to himſelfe onely one Title, and in ſcorne of that foolery of <hi>Spaine</hi> did repeate it frequently in his an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer (letter of credence,) ſo I may ſay in this bun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe, <hi>ſi magnis licet componere parva,</hi> if we may take an example of that wiſe King (as I think I may) in
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:64385:19"/>place, where all others ſpeake of many tongues, I ſay it is but one; and therefore the antiquity of <hi>Calde, Samaritan, Syriac, Arabic and Ethiopic</hi> is not the an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiquity of many, but onely of one and the ſelfe ſame <hi>Ebrew</hi> tougue. So than, that we may come to the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluſion of the firſt point, I affirme, (and am able to make it good againſt all oppoſers) that <hi>Ebrew, Calde, Samaritan, Syriac, Arabic,</hi> &amp; <hi>Ethiopic</hi> were from the very beginning of <hi>Adams</hi> creation, and do remaine yet with us in the world, they were before and after the confuſion of Babell, and are therefore the Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther tongue of all tongues in the world.</p>
                  <p>The ſecond point is, the rare vertues of theſe Ori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>entall Tongues, <hi>viz. Ebrew, Calde, Samaritan, Syriac, Arabic,</hi> and <hi>Ethiopic,</hi> whereby they are far more no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble then <hi>Greeke, Latine</hi> or any of the eſteemed learned tongues. And here I confeſſe, I ſee before me ſuch a vaſtneſſe of an excellent plaine, where my horſe could runne, not only a moſt gallant courſe, but even out of breath; yet not to hazard ſo much, becauſe I muſt uſe that my loving creature many times more, and with more advantage hereafter, than yet I conceive to be at this race, I will at this time not ſo much as permit it to a Gallop, but keepe it in a ſmooth and painles pace, being aſſured of its willing<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes upon any other preſented occaſion. That moſt naturall ſimpleneſſe or ſingleneſſe in the comporte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of this grave Lady doth keep me ſtill in a wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full obedience and a ſilent admiration, nay adorati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of that divinity. You will ſinde here a Divinity in pedegree, a comelineſſe in attire, a conſtancy in their nature and faſhions, a gravity in few ſpeeches, a due obſervation of ſenſefull ordrings of words, a brevity in their contractions, an hatted of confuſion of the ſame, a providence in placing them, no ſuperfluity in ſervants, a certaine office ordered unto every one
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:64385:19"/>of them; even accounted ſuperfluous by men igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant in their affaires, have their charge of a good turne. Their conſtant number of roots, the eaſy or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der to finde them out, planted all as in an Orchard, by ſquare, that whereſoever you ſend your eyes, you behold the ſame diſtance of each other. Every tree of them of a divers ſavor and gracious taſte with a delightfull ſmell. The branches of theſe trees orde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red, yeelding hundreds of fruits, to wit, words, all of the ſame taſte and ſmell, yet with ſome diverſity: So that <hi>Ebrew, Calde, Samaritan, Syriac, Arabic</hi> and <hi>Ethiopic</hi> according to many Authours and Books yet extant, have as large an extent, as the <hi>Greek</hi> of <hi>Latine</hi> Tongue. For being a full tongue as well as <hi>Latine</hi> or <hi>Greek,</hi> it muſt needs follow, that all the <hi>Ebrew</hi> Language muſt repreſent the whole <hi>Latine</hi> and <hi>Greek:</hi> the <hi>Calde</hi> or <hi>Samaritan</hi> all the ſame; <hi>Syriac, Arabic</hi> and <hi>Ethiopic</hi> the ſame. Neither doth it con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tradict me and my tenents, that the Bible doth not containe the whole <hi>Ebrew</hi> tongue, therefore this tongue doth not comprehend the whole <hi>Latine</hi> tongue. For I never ſaid, that this tongue, as it is extant onely in the <hi>Ebrew</hi> Bible, doth containe all the <hi>Latine</hi> tongue, even becauſe there is not the whole <hi>Ebrew</hi> language in the <hi>Ebrew</hi> Bible, but is part<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly yet in <hi>Caldean,</hi> &amp;c. Authours. The whole Orientall tongue doth include the whole Occidentall be it <hi>Greek, Latine, German, Engliſh, Spaniſh, French, Italien</hi> or whatſoever. And there is wonder enough in it. I dare ſay that thoſe words which are in the <hi>Ebrew</hi> Bible do containe moſt part of the <hi>GGreek</hi> or <hi>Latine</hi> tongue, that is, the greateſt part of the <hi>Latine</hi> or <hi>Greek</hi> tongue is expreſſable by ſuch words, as are in the <hi>Ebrew</hi> Bible, be they never ſo few in compari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon of that great voluminous vaſtity of Latine or Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſh it ſelfe. If we do admire the nature of this tongue,
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:64385:20"/>we may juſtly exclaime even in behalfe of it, as the Apoſtle in a higher ſtraine concerning the nature of men under unbelief and confuſion, and the capaci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of Gods mercyes upon all. <hi>O the depth of the riches both of the wiſedome and knowledge of God, how un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſearchable are his judgements, and his wayes paſt find<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing out?</hi> For God is as well the cauſe of this his holy tongue, which he was pleaſed firſt to beſtow upon mankind, as He was the Creatour of the firſt <hi>Adam,</hi> and in him of all mankind. Yet as there was another ſtate in <hi>Adam</hi> even after his fall, more livelineſſe, leſſe dulneſſe, more ſimpleneſſe and fingleneſſe of hearts, leſſe troubles of the affaires of the world, neerer with God, becauſe leſſe objects from God, more cleare ſighted even in naturall things, becauſe uſing more his reaſon, diligency and induſtrie on them, and more bleſſed in his undertakings, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe with a more ſingle heart, ſo that in many hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dreds of things <hi>Adam</hi> was even after the fall yet ſo much more perfect, than we. No leſſe it was with this tongue, partly before the confuſion of Babel as in the ſtate of innocency; <hi>Few and full words.</hi> Which fulneſſe is wonderous in all mens eyes, and yet not ſearched from whence. Therefore, If I ſhall not doe a miſſe, I ſhall rather give a hint at that well and foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine, to lead you unto it, than at this time to bring you many cups full of that wholeſome living water flowing, nay ſpringing from thence. It is undenia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, that a thing is but one in eſſence, and yet has divers accidents, more or leſſe, ſo the word ſigni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fying a thing, and but one thing alſo, which words we call the roote, thoſe words, thoſe roots do onely ſignifie that one tree. And every tree, though never ſo many, if they are of the ſame ſtock, will have all the ſame taſte; whereby it comes to paſſe, that 20.50.100. words in <hi>Ebrew,</hi> &amp;c. deſcending from the
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:64385:20"/>ſame roote and tree, do yeeld naturally alike taſte or ſignification, and yet they are individuals and divers in number. The taſte then is one and the ſame, the radicall ſignification is but one, not 2, 3, 4, 6. or more, as hitherto all the Dictionary Writers have falſly aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerted, even againſt nature it ſelfe, yeelding unto one and the ſame roote or tree many and divers taſts. Which aſſertion holds yet, becauſe they are all but ill gardiners, onely conſidering the outward ſhape of the fruits, and therefore the taſte being a little diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent, they preſently conclude againſt the nature of all trees, that one and the ſame roote or tree can have divers taſtes or ſignifications. When other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe if they would but ſearch and conferre the taſte of this with the taſte of the other fruit, they would finde a ſweet analogie between them, <hi>viz.</hi> that there is but one taſte in every tree, and ſo define that taſte or ſignification. But by what meanes doth the ſame taſte ſeeme to be divers, and ſo dazle the eyes of learned men, and withdraw their judgement? I an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer, becauſe they think not. 1. That tongues are onely proper to men and not beaſts. 2. That men have onely a more perfect reaſon, and that in an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finite higher degree than the beaſts, in ſo much that for the diſtance thereof theſe are deemed to have al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt none at all. 3. That languages have reaſon in them, and proceed with reaſon, out of reaſon, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>companyed and followed by it. 4. That men have naturally <hi>Logic, Rhetoric, Phyſic, Metaphyfic, Ethic:</hi> becauſe all theſe (being called Arts) are branches of Reaſon. 5. That all theſe Arts naturally inhabiting in a man, do infould themſelves firſt in that thing, whereby reaſon of a reaſonable creature is onely ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſt, that is, in the language of a man; and ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>condly all ſpeeches are by reaſon teinted more or leſſe, according as man makes uſe of his reaſon. 6. That
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:64385:21"/>as all men have onely one and the ſame reaſon, as the world onely one and the ſame ſunne, ſo all tongues have alſo one and the ſame reaſon. 7. That <hi>Logic, Rhe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>toric, Ethic, Phyſic, Metaphyſic,</hi> (conſidered as it is in any Phyloſopher of any part of the world,) doth naturally, <hi>firſt,</hi> beautifie, amplifie, enlarge, determine the ſignifications of any word and root or tree, how far they may proceed, and not father; as alſo, <hi>ſecondly,</hi> diſtinguiſh and keep them from confuſion, contradiction, implication, and <hi>thirdly,</hi> joyne thoſe, and ſhew in what meaſure, and how far to joyne, which otherwiſe ſeeme to be divers, and of a clear other tree and roote, 8. That by theſe meanes thoſe moſt ancient tongues, (I ſpeake now in plurall, rather as people ſpeake, than according to the truth) <hi>Ebrew, Calde, Samaritan, Syriac, Arabic</hi> and <hi>Ethiopic,</hi> have<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing but few roots in reſpect of <hi>Greec</hi> and <hi>Latine,</hi> yet are multiplied beyond all expectation in ſignifications by <hi>Rhetoric, Logic, Phyſic</hi> and <hi>Metaphyſic; viz.</hi> by reaſon onely. 9. That the nature of the Orientall tongue is for the moſt part the very ſame with the nature of the Occidentall, <hi>viz. Ebrew</hi> it ſelfe, <hi>Calde, Samaritan, Syriac, Arabic</hi> and <hi>Ethiopic</hi> hath the greateſt part of its nature even as <hi>Engliſh,</hi> it beeing no way leſſe inſtructed by reaſon than theſe; neither hath <hi>Ebrew</hi> by way of reaſon a grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter preeminency then <hi>Engliſh,</hi> or any occidentall tongue. 10. That the ſame metaphors, metony<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies, ſynecdoches, proper and tranſlate ſignifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, the ſame Ironicall expreſſions are every where, becauſe there is the ſame reaſon in all tongues, and among all men. 11. And therefore the ſame metaphoricall, metonymical, ſynecdochical, ironical ſignifications in words. 12. And that among others we may, and many times can, nay muſt frequently conſider the ſignifications of one word in <hi>Latine,</hi> how
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:64385:21"/>manifold they are, as alſo in many other occidentall tongues, and applie them in the Orientall, and then proceeding thus with reaſon, we ſhall finde a neerer conformity, than hetherto beleeved, and greater diſtinction, than hoped for; and all this, out of a more large ample, and naturall well, even that eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal fountaine REASON, than out of the beſt <hi>Iewes, Rabbins, Syrians, Arabians</hi> and <hi>Ethiopians</hi> themſelves. 13. That in this tongue is never a compounded word, as there is in <hi>Latine</hi> &amp; <hi>Greek,</hi> and that therefore it muſt neceſſarily follow, that all the compound ſig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifications of any ſimple word in thoſe languages muſt alſo be compriſed in that ſimple <hi>Ebrew</hi> root. 14. The reaſon of which aſſertion is clear, becauſe that all the compound words, (I underſtand the compoſitions, with the praepoſitions <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap>, &amp;c. <hi>a, ab, abs, ac, ad, af, ag, al, am, an, ap, ar, as, at, e, ex,</hi> &amp;c.) have ſtill this ſimple word as that <hi>unum tertium,</hi> a naturall meeting in that word, whereby all the compound words being joyned as in the body, ſo in the eſſence and ſubſtance of ſignification with ſome ſmall alteration, addition, or detraction, of and unto that ſimple and firſt ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance.</p>
                  <p>Such and the like things being ſet down in the gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall ſearch of tongues, will ſhew the nature, beauty, &amp; comlines of this Oriential tongue. And if any man de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand of me, what ſpeciall uſe may be made of the ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>glenes of this ſirnamed Orientall tongue beyond the Occidental, where there is ſar greater toyle in compo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſition, many terminations without any neede, as for example in the Latine, ſix caſes in ſingular, &amp; as many in plurall, ſo many Declenſions in Nounes, and Conju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gations in verbs, divers terminations for all perſons, various both in Active and Paſſive, and an infinite of ſuch like conceits, theſe being almoſt al wanting in this Originall tongue. I anſwer, that even from thence
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:64385:22"/>we in the Occident and North may begin to looke a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout us, and from the corruption of our tongues, (and the great variety of circumſtantiall additions, and detractions, multiplications and diviſions, (in <hi>Greec</hi> and <hi>Latine</hi>) in nature clearely ſuperfluous) learne to eſteeme more of the naturall ſimplicity of this firſt tongue, which like unto <hi>Adam</hi> in his innocency (with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out ſo many garments and additions about his limbs as wee now weare about us) is ſtill the moſt comely, gracious, goodly, neate, and tractable tongue, and that which is moſt agreeable to the nature of man, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiring to be ſtudied more by reaſon than an infinity of rules, more trying the uſe of our reaſon, than the ſtrength of our memory. In one word, it makes us (when by the <hi>Greec</hi> and <hi>Latine</hi> wee were become beaſts, by <gap reason="foreign">

                     <hi>ſo tels me my Maſter Adam</hi>) to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come <hi>Adam</hi> our ſelves; to be no more under the law but under the ſweet yoake of reaſon: differing as much from our former condition of ſtuding tongues as reaſonable <hi>Adam</hi> did from any of his ſubjected beaſts; whereof none, was found to match with him, being farre inferiour to his condition. So that this Primitive tongue (whether in Orthography, Analo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gie or Syntax) is as ſingle and ſimple as the <hi>Engliſh</hi> it ſelfe; having (in Orthography) no more letters or conſonants, (although ſome of them are uſed in place of vowells) having no caſe, nor ſcarſe any maſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culine or feminine gender, much leſſe neuter, com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon or Epicene, no active or paſſive (much leſſe neuter or Deponent, no Infinity or Terminations in numbers, much leſſe in perſons then commonly is taught. No Declentions at all in Nownes, nor Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jugations in Verbs, no Modes without any more Ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes then nature requires, viz. <hi>The preſent,</hi> DO THOU &amp; YE, <hi>the future</hi> I, THOU, HE, WE, YE, THEY, WILL DO, and <hi>Pretertenſe</hi> I, THOU, HE, WEE,
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:64385:22"/>YE, THEY, HAVE DONE. All the ſuperfluities of a Preſens in Indicative, Optative, and Conjunctive in the firſt, ſecond, &amp; third perſon ſingular or plurall are wiſely cut away and not found. The imperfect &amp; plus quam perfect of the Indicative, Optative, and Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>junctive are compriſed with only one Pretertence, the Future the ſame. What an eaſineſſe makes this in a language? If you ſay I ſpeake cleare otherwiſe then other Gramarians have and doe ſpeake of this tongue. I anſwer, that I would not have you to regard what either I, this, or that man ſayes concerning this tongue but what it doth afford its ſelfe, and when thoſe rules, that are moſt confidently ſet downe by former Gra<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>marians, are found by themſelves and others to have ſo many exceptions, as that the examples of theſe ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny times outreach the number of thoſe, doth it not clearely ſhew that that rule is indeede of no value, uſe, or authority? Nay the Syntax is that part of Grammer that will ſhew the neceſſity or ſuperfluity of things taught in Analogy: For if there bee never ſo many diſtinctions and diviſions of this or that part in Analogy, and Syntax authorize it not with the utility, but rather cry it downe by its independency or indifferency of uſe; we may thinke it to be rather ſome fancy of a mans braine then the nature of the tongue. And of that ſort of <hi>adiophorâs</hi> in this tongue are almoſt gender, number and perſon, adjective and ſubſtanſtive, &amp;c. The order of the ſubject &amp; predicate will eaſily bee obſerved if you know the ſimple and ſingle taſt or ſignification of the root, and have learnt (in other tongues) Rhetorick and Logick, to know how ſuch and ſuch a ſignification may (by theſe Arts) bee inlarged, diſtinguiſhed, determined and turned into many and divers faſhions, (yet ſo as that it ſtill retaine the naturall, ideall, or radicall taſt,) and that applyed to our <hi>Ebrew, Calde, Samaritan, Syriac,
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:64385:23"/>Arabic,</hi> and <hi>Ethiopic</hi> roots and words) will yeeld all helps that can be required to know the true ſence of that text: contrarily if wee have never ſo many rules, they will rather confound our underſtandings, obſcure our reaſon, undermine our judgement, and in place of helpes, bring us into farther confuſion. Reaſon with few rules and prerequiſite ſignification of words (which the Dictionaries have hitherto but meanely afforded and muſt hereafter be more fully diſcove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red and ſet downe) may bee multiplyed or devided, and according to the place ſoundly applyed by the helpe of <hi>Logic, Rhethorick,</hi> and <hi>Phyſick,</hi> and <hi>Metaphy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſic,</hi>) will containe all <hi>Syntax</hi> in very few rules, and then no rules can be expected without reaſon. Yet more eſpecially to diſcribe you in a competent brevity the nature of this tongue you ſhal have a<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>nexed a plaine, little, &amp; full grammer, at leaſt fuller then that I formerly ſet out in Engliſh upon one ſheet in three columnes in folio for <hi>Orthography Etimology</hi> and <hi>Syn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taxis,</hi> according to that brevity, (whereof thoſe that deſired it ſo ſhort did ſhew me a patterne made be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore me by ſome other learned Author,) and after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards in ſome meaſure enlarged by my paines, and publiſhed under the title of THE RVDIMENTS OF THE HEBREW GRAMMER IN ENGLISH, &amp;c. this yeare 1648. but much ſpoyled in the publication, it not being according to my will, as the following is.</p>
                  <p>The third point concerning their largeneſſe, is part<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly cleare in the largeneſſe of time wherein they conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nued, partly of place where they have been &amp; are yet in uſe. That of time, if it were only for a meane Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour of Antiquity, we have ſpoken enough of it in the firſt particular. But this having ſome farther intention, it is not to be pretermitted. Then there is no <hi>Ebrew, Calde, Samaritane, Syriac, Arabic,</hi> or <hi>Ethiopic</hi> ſo ancient as the Bible and <hi>Moſes.</hi> Therefore in thoſe
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:64385:23"/>Greec Authors that have written of all thoſe Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tries, where this holy Language was naturally and continually in full courſe, and having written in the Greec tongue, and thereby confounded almoſt all the names of the Orientall places, perſons and things in ſo much, that without a diligent ſearch of this mother tongue, we ſhall never be able to finde out what they meane therby, nor wil the Greec paraphraſts, interpre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters, Dictionaries, or any thing elſe of theirs be able to helpe us in any thing, which themſelves were as ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norant of, as thoſe Authors they would cleare up, ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving not themſelves that which they would give to o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers. Now of all theſe thouſands of Greec Authors, there is not one to bee expected, that hath not now and then more or leſſe of ſome Orientall words, and that ſo corruptly, that his ſenſe even thereby be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comes obſcure, becauſe the ſence of thoſe words re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maine ſo. Then to cleare them up, there will be no more ſure and catholick remedy, than to learne to reduce all the corrupt <hi>Greec</hi> words, tranſlated out of this Orientall tongue, to their proper place, where if once brought, will preſently yeeld a full and clear commentary upon the ſaid author whatſoever. The ſame may be ſaid of many hundred of <hi>Latine</hi> Authors; as being in the ſame way of darkneſſe, and hereby to be brought unto light. Largeneſſe of ſpace at this preſent time upwards to about 1000. yeares ago, is all the ſame yet, and can be made good in few words. Whole <hi>Africa</hi> has had from its very being and begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning till this day this and the ſame tongue. If you ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject, <hi>Greec</hi> and <hi>Latine</hi> has bin there, I anſwer, yea, I confeſſe it, but onely as <hi>French</hi> and <hi>Low dutch</hi> is preached here at <hi>London</hi> and ſome other places of <hi>England:</hi> not being in <hi>Africa</hi> as the Mother, but on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly as the Forraigne tongue, exerciſed by ſtrangers: the Mother tongue being this primitive of <hi>Adam,</hi>
                     <pb n="22" facs="tcp:64385:24"/>which in all Authors of many hundreds of places may be ſhewed, and is partly moſt excellently conjctured at by divers learned Authours. It will be further ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jected, another tongue to have bin in <hi>Egypt, viz.</hi> that which cal'd <hi>Joſef, Zofnat Faneah</hi> (in our Engliſh tranſlation <hi>Zaphnath-Paaneah.</hi> Gen. 41:45.) which they ſay is not of this tongue, but ſome other called the <hi>Coptic</hi> tongue, which they would have to be diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent from this true <hi>Ebrew.</hi> I anſwer, that all that is true, that the <hi>Copic</hi> tongue, which was uſed in that Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vince of <hi>Egypt</hi> cal'd <hi>Copt</hi> or <hi>Coptus</hi> in <hi>Greek</hi> and <hi>Latine,</hi> naturally and by the true native inhabitants, is the very ſame language, which was ſpoken by <hi>Pharaoh,</hi> and in which <hi>Joſeph</hi> was thus intituled. But to call that corrupt, fals <hi>Coptic,</hi> which was brought in with the <hi>Grecians,</hi> when the <hi>Pharaonſes</hi> (or Princes) and Kings of <hi>Egypt</hi> gave them leave, not onely to dwell here and there in many townes and villages, as Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chants and Handicraftmen, but alſo more eſpecially the prouince and Metropolis of that province <hi>Copt</hi> being truly Greec, but now ſo corrupted with that min<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gling of this holy tongue then uſed from the begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning of the firſt introduction of it by <hi>Mizrayim</hi> (whereof <hi>Egipt</hi> at this very day has its name being by the Inhabitants themſelves called <hi>Miſr,</hi> not <hi>Egypt,</hi> a name brought in onely by the Grecians from their more ſpeciall dwelling place, <hi>viz.</hi> that ſhire <hi>Copt, Cypt</hi> or <hi>Gypt,</hi> that it is neither <hi>Ebrew</hi> nor <hi>Greec,</hi> but a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſion of both, having many words of <hi>Greec,</hi> with an Egyptian or Arabic termination; ſo farre denie I, that that minglemoos is the true <hi>Coptic,</hi> naturall and native tongue of the <hi>Egyptians.</hi> About the <hi>Ethio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pic</hi> there will be more objections. From whence I have, that that Countrie has the ſame tongue in eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence, notwithſtanding corrupted by divers and many hundred of Accidents. I anſwer, out of their bookes,
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:64385:24"/>to wit out of the New-Teſtament, and ſome part of the old (viz. the Pſalmes tranſlated into <hi>Etiopien,</hi> and printed in <hi>Germany</hi> at <hi>Collen</hi> by art, induſtry &amp; lear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning of <hi>John Potken,</hi> Rector of <hi>Georg Collen,</hi> An. 1508 in 4<hi rend="sup">o</hi>. together with <hi>Greec, Latine,</hi> &amp; <hi>Ebrew;</hi> with an in troduction unto this tongue) we have more clearneſſe and notice concerning it, than from all the voyages unto it, or paſſages through it, deſcribed by divers men of <hi>Italie, Spaine, France, Engeland, Germany</hi> and the <hi>Low-Country.</hi> So that it remaines true, that in whole <hi>Africa,</hi> the native and true naturall tongue is onely this ſame tongue, yet with ſome diverſity of accidents, which though never ſo many, are not able to bring that one eſſence to a diverſity and confuſion. And whereas it will be further objected, that former<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly there have bin divers tongues, but loſt; as for inſtance; the <hi>Punic</hi> tongue, wherein <hi>Plautus</hi> in his <hi>Poenulus</hi> or <hi>Punicien Moor</hi> has left ſome remainders, and that that paſſage is attempted to be cleared by many Authours, yet it ſtill remaines in darkneſſe. I anſwer, that names of this tongue there have bin, and are at this day many, and may be made many more, which never the leſſe cannot change the eſſence of this nor any other tongue, and they were called <hi>Poeni,</hi> whereof <hi>Poenulus,</hi> (as <hi>Graeci, Graeculus,</hi>) becauſe they came out of <hi>Phoenicia</hi> (which you may call alſo <hi>Poenicia</hi>) from <hi>Tyre</hi> and <hi>Sydon</hi> (whereof is mention made. <hi>Mat.</hi> 15:21. <hi>Mar.</hi> 7:24. <hi>Luc.</hi> 6:17. and elſe where) and all the adjacent parts of that very ſame Mediterranean Sea of the <hi>Phoeniciens</hi> with theſe <hi>Poe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niciens.</hi> Now then, ſeeing this people (the <hi>Poeni</hi> in Latine, or <hi>Poeniciens</hi>) were the children and new Plantation of thoſe <hi>Phoenicens,</hi> that did properly and naturally ſpeake this primitive, holy and moſt ancient tongue, no doubt, but they brought with them their owne tongue and pronunciation; and notwithſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:64385:25"/>that perhaps they might finde a language there, yet becauſe they found onely a new and divers pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nunciation of their owne (even as here in England all along the ſeaſhore the pronunciation doth change and vary round about this great Iſland) it was eaſily joyned with theirs, and yet the pronunciation for the moſt part by time might change into the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuntiation of that country, not from whence, but un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to whom they came. As for that place of <hi>Poenulus</hi> by that old Comedian writer <hi>Plautus,</hi> (a very excellent <hi>Latine</hi> Authour, but full of ſuch words, as do deſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cend from this primitive tongue,) no doubt but it is by divers Authours finely and cleerely enough ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plicated, and may yet be farther cleared not onely by me, but by many others alſo: nevertheleſſe if that <hi>Poenic</hi> or <hi>Punic</hi> tongue (being all &amp; the ſame as I write in <hi>Latine Punio</hi> and <hi>Poena,</hi>) there in <hi>Plautus</hi> will not appeare to be altogether ſuch <hi>Ebrew,</hi> as we have in the Bible, we muſt not therefore deny it to be this tongue, becauſe I ſay, there are many thouſand accidents of this one tongue, as there are in all the reſt of the whole world, <hi>viz.</hi> diverſity of vowels, changement of Accents unto a divers ſilla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, and the diverſity of pronunciation of the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonants themſelves; which changement comes from the diverſity of the <hi>Climas,</hi> wherein one and the ſame language is extant. Beſides we muſt obſerve, that the <hi>Punic</hi> Alfabet, being different from that of the <hi>Romans</hi> (the diverſity whereof you may ſee in my delineation of the <hi>Ebrew</hi> Orthography and Etymo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>logie printed in <hi>Latine</hi> at <hi>Amſterdam</hi> 1646. 4<hi rend="sup">o</hi>. <hi>pag.</hi> 3.) and <hi>Plautus</hi> himſelfe or others, bringing theſe words from the <hi>Punic</hi> Alfabet into the Roman Let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters, (as it is the naturall inclination of all men now, to be careleſſe in a juſt and due obſerving of the Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thographie of a ſtrange tongue naturall to, &amp; obſerved
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:64385:25"/>by its nation,) made no great matter about the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſions in wrong or right and due <hi>Roman</hi> letters. Thirdly, When we conſider the many faults, which (from <hi>Plautus</hi> writing till this very day in written or printed Copies) did frequently incroach, it is no wonder, if we finde but ſmall remainders of <hi>Ebrew,</hi> nay more wonder, if any at all. The ſecond part of largeneſſe of ſpace, is leſſe, to wit in <hi>Aſia,</hi> where firſt this tongue was given unto <hi>Adam,</hi> and is yet ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tant full, pure, and incorrupt from <hi>Perſia</hi> hether<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards till at the Mediterranian <hi>Sea;</hi> from the <hi>Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſian</hi> Gulfe all the land incloſed within that and the <hi>Arabian</hi> Gulfe, which is commonly cald <hi>Arabia,</hi> till <hi>Egipt</hi> (or <hi>Aegypt</hi>) it ſelfe, whole <hi>Paleſtine</hi> or all <hi>Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dea,</hi> all <hi>Meſopotamia,</hi> all <hi>Syria.</hi> So that ſeeing all theſe Countryes of one tract, have all one tongue, making together from the <hi>Perſian</hi> Sea or Gulfe, till the <hi>Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diterranian</hi> Sea no more Land, than <hi>Germany,</hi> which has alſo but one tongue, (ſomtimes cald the <hi>Saxon,</hi> (my owne Mother Tongue, the ſame with that old <hi>Saxon</hi> here in <hi>England;</hi>) alſo the High and Low <hi>Ger<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man</hi> or <hi>Duch</hi> tongues, though the eſſence be but one: no more different, than the <hi>Engliſh</hi> and <hi>Scots</hi> tongue which commonly by other nations and ſtrangers (ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norant of the tongue of theſe two nations) are eſteem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed different? becauſe it has two names, <hi>Engliſh</hi> and <hi>Scots.</hi> Yet as this tongue on this ſide the <hi>Perſian</hi> Gulfe is incorrupt, ſo in <hi>Perſia, Turkey, Mogul, Tatar,</hi> and all the Eaſtern parts of the great <hi>Tatary</hi> untill <hi>China</hi> it has as great an influx authority and uſe upon them, as <hi>Latine</hi> or <hi>French</hi> has upon <hi>Engliſh</hi> or <hi>Saxon</hi> here in <hi>England.</hi> For as the <hi>Engliſh</hi> Nation doth write now at this day all things with <hi>Latine</hi> Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racters, ſo alſo do all thoſe forraigne tongues uſe the Character of the <hi>Arabians,</hi> which is in eſſence the ſame with <hi>Ebrew,</hi> onely more roundly formed and
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:64385:26"/>joyned together; with no more difference, than <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſh</hi> written and joyned together, with the printed, where the characters are ſeparate. And as the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcent of their Religion, Learning, Experience and Wit doth deſcend (partly by, partly without bookes) out of the hithermoſt parts of the <hi>Perſian</hi> Gulfe unto them, ſo theſe things being coyned in this holy pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitive tongue, whereof even among the <hi>Turkes, Perſians,</hi> Greater and Leſſe <hi>Tatariens</hi> is the ſame eſteeme of Holineſſe and Prerogative of it before theirs and all the tongues of this whole round; they do honour the tongue and words of it, and uſe many thouſands of them in their ſpeeches, lofty diſcourſes, ſermons, courtings, writings, commands, poems, Romances, teachings, epiſtles or letters; with no leſſe ambition to ſhew their learning, than our wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters in <hi>Latine</hi> do now and than ſhew <hi>Ebrue, Calde, Samaritane, Syriac</hi> and <hi>Arabic</hi> or at leaſt <hi>Greek</hi> or in <hi>Engliſh</hi> wheare are frequently coyned new <hi>Engliſh</hi> words out of pure <hi>Latine.</hi> And notwithſtanding that the common tongue be different, being only frequent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly aſperſed and beautified by thoſe floures and dain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, yet is this the onely tongue, which the learned or learnedſt men do uſe, to make knowne their ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellent wit, not onely unto their own Nation and Country, but alſo unto all <hi>Aſia</hi> over. So that this ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly or primitive tongue doth paſſe among the learned men through <hi>Perſia,</hi> Great <hi>Mogul</hi> and <hi>Malayen</hi> Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try till the very <hi>Chinas</hi> themſelves, and that with a great deale higher repute and reſpect, than all theſe common tongues either at home, or elſe where. Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the Key, whereby to inſinuate ones ſelfe into men of repute and great eminency, who have their great honour as of other excellent parts within them, ſo alſo and moſt cheefly from this tongue. So that even thoſe, that knew onely this holy Tongue, are
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:64385:26"/>accounted to be as Saints and holy men, reputed, eſteemed, adored, glorified, imbraced, reſpected and deſired with all prevalent wayes, to grant their converſation and meeting. Nay it is certaine, that even they who have naturally this tongue, (un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der whatſoever name by us or them, and whatſoever Religion or ſect, whatſoever character of writing,) are looked upon as thoſe, that God hath bin pleaſed to grant their undoubted deſcent from <hi>Noah,</hi> and ſo from <hi>Adam,</hi> becauſe they ſpeake <hi>Noahs</hi> and <hi>Adams</hi> tongue; and to have the prerogative to be of the ſeed of <hi>Abraham</hi> either by <hi>Sarah</hi> or his Concubines, (in Orient of little leſſe eſteeme than the true wife,) whereas the reſt of the people did live in Idolatry, ſo they which have not <hi>Abrahams</hi> tongue to be borne <hi>extra eccleſiam</hi> out of the bounds of the true viſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble Church, and onely brought unto that glory and happineſſe by men of his linage, to wit, <hi>Moſes, David, Jeſus Chriſt</hi> and <hi>Mahomed</hi> that <hi>Arabian</hi> impoſter in Chief.</p>
                  <p>I come now to the fourth part of this Diſcourſe, to ſhew the uſe of this primitive tongue in the world yet at this day extant. It is of more uſe, than <hi>Engliſh, Scotch, French, Italian, Spaniſh, Portugis, Germain, Low Dutch, Daniſh, Swediſh,</hi> or <hi>Norwegiſh.</hi> And ſo much have we ſhewed in the ſecond part, ſo that I thinke no reaſonable man can judge that tongue to be of no uſe, which ſo great a part of the world makes uſe of, except we conceave the heaven not to be of ſuch uſe to them, as it is unto us, and that the Sun doth not ſhine there as cleare as here Even as many fooles at this very day in <hi>Aſia</hi> and <hi>Africa,</hi> who will not be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeve, that we can have the Sun, or that it ſhines as bright with us as them, becauſe it falles into the Sea as ſoon as it hath paſſed <hi>Africa,</hi> juſt at the weſt end of it, from whence it is called in Orient <hi>Dulmagrib,</hi>
                     <pb n="28" facs="tcp:64385:27"/>with ſome parts of <hi>Spaine</hi> thereabout ſo cald at this very day; ſome I ſay of them do beleeve, that with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in the firſt mile of that <hi>Spaniſh</hi> Sea down fals the Sun and all the reſt of the <hi>Northern</hi> Countries, (as <hi>England, Scotland, Ireland, France</hi> and the <hi>Low Countries,</hi> &amp;c) have no light, no Sun, no comfort, continual darke<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe, ſtorme, winter, raine, ſnow, night, froſt, almoſt ſtarved, having no bread, no fleſh, chicknes, lamb, ſheep, gees, ducks, capons, harts, beef, mutton, hennes, egges, doves, feaſants, partridges, woodcoks or any ſort of fowle, or fiſh, but that we feed onely on graſſe and herbes of the field, now and then for a great deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cacy a mouſe, rat, or cat, dog or fox, &amp;c. Now as we pitty this their blindneſſe and childiſhneſſe of judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, ſo we may this (no leſſe childiſh opinion of our owne) <hi>that this tongue is of no uſe at all.</hi> Why? becauſe we know none. Away I pray with ſuch chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diſh ſtuff, and let us talke like men. Have we in <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land</hi> any profit by our tongue, can we make uſe of it or no? The anſwer is cleare. But they ſay. Nay the ſtrangers muſt be here conſidered, not the people themſelves. And what uſe for us <hi>Engliſh</hi> men of <hi>Ebrew, Calde, Samaritan, Syriac, Arabic</hi> and <hi>Ethiopic</hi> tongues and ſuch rabbles more. Firſt I ſay. All theſe are but one tongue, and it muſt be a poore braine that cannot learne one beſides his Mother tongue. And <hi>England</hi> muſt needs be a ſilly Country, if their people never had a heart to go abroad, to ſee other Countryes. Now there are a thouſand wayes, wherby <hi>Engliſh</hi> men may fall either into love or neceſſity to ſee thoſe countries; at which accident if you wil know whether the tongue will do you good or not, let us ſee, if any ſtranger coming into <hi>England</hi> will finde comfort by it, if at leaſt he can pratle a little broken <hi>Engliſh.</hi> Indeed men bereaved of all ſenſes ſpeake thus childiſhly, as if there were no uſe of that tongue for us. What a
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:64385:27"/>tongue to be the only Country tongue in whole <hi>Afri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ca,</hi> and the third part of <hi>Aſia,</hi> and by the ſecond third part a Learned tongue, (which alwayes are of a higher eſteem than common tongues) and all this tongue without uſe? Is their Sun, when it comes to us, of great uſe and grace, and can we think, that their tongue will not be pleaſant unto us, if we onely will not abhorre it? Is not even the Sun ſuperfluous unto a laſie body, and to him that deſires not to ſtirre out of the bed, when the Sun doth ſhine? Is therefore the Sun of no uſe becauſe ſuch laſie bodyes would wiſh it might remain night? Thoſe that buy the nights at a great price, and when they are overtaken by the a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſing of the Sun, before they think, they had enough for their payment, ſhall (for ſuch filthy ſtinking bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dyes, and whoremaſters, and all other uncleane per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons) the Sun (that precious creature with its comfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table beames) be ſtopped and cryed out of the ſight? Is whole <hi>Africa</hi> not many times bigger than <hi>England,</hi> hath not <hi>Aſia</hi> alſo every way as rich, nay farre more rich Countryes than this is? and if ſome unlearned men have an ill opinion of theſe tongues, ſhall no learned men be credited to the contrary? There are divers Authors already extant in <hi>Engliſh,</hi> which doe ſhew the ſecrets of Merchandiſe in thoſe two parts of the world, <hi>Africa</hi> and <hi>Aſia,</hi> I pray and beſeech the Courteous Reader, if thou canſt love gold and ſilver, all ſorts of precious ſtones, and be contented, that thy wife be richly cloathed, her eares and fingers, her hatſtring and armrings or bracelets, her breaſts and neck, and all the reſt of her body accordingly and as faſhion doth deſire to be inriched with precious pearls and ſtones, as rubies, diamonds, fafirs, turcoiſes, car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>buncles and all ſorts of medals, if theſe things only or more rare and precious, do fall in <hi>Aſia</hi> and <hi>Africa</hi> in that country, where this primitive tongue is ſpoken,
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:64385:28"/>and being alwayes certaine, that a Merchant that can onely prattle, ſhall buy any ware cheaper, and at a better rate, than he that can ſpeake nothing, but muſt truſt to his interpreter and fellow, and that hereby he may get greater gaines in an houre, than a whole yeare by iron and other mettall even here in <hi>England</hi> it ſelfe, eſpecially ſeeing the Commodity is the more ſhure, by how much it is leſſe trouble<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſome or burthenſome. Yea farther if whole Compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nyes trade thitherwards, and will not ſend men onely with one eye, one hand, one leg, one arme, one eare, but if it be poſſible, as good, ſound, wel ſhaped ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſt <hi>Engliſh</hi> factors, as they have had in their ſhops and trade, or meet withall, and thinke you not, that you now ſend out no better then ſuch. I ſay not, that they come not home better, than they went, for that would be a ſoule buſineſſe indeed, if they ſhould go better with one legg, than with two, and ſee better with one eye, than two. Onely the queſtion is now, if ye are well contented with their ſervice, if they make you as good returnes from thence, as they did, when you did ſend them all along through <hi>England,</hi> where they knew the tongue? I am ſhure, you would be content; and I wiſh they did ſo. But I feare, that if the companies do finiſh, cloſe and make up their account of ſome yeares paſt, they will find but ſmall profit for all their dangers and pains. And if they, which the Merchants doe ſend, knew the tongue, what Ambaſſadours thinke you ſhould ye need for a handfull of factors? And theſe Ambaſſadours what ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellent profit have they brought into the treaſure of any company whatſoever by ignorance of the tongues; whereby they are not eſteemed, diſreſpected contem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned, ſcorned, kict at, and by their ill behaviour all the Nation doth ſuffer, where ſome other of leſſe ranck and condition can paſſe through theſe ſtrange Nati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons,
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:64385:28"/>without need of Ambaſſadours, do his worke without reſiſtance, without a protection of an Am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>baſſadour, only becauſe he has God and the Tongue. I will not jarre any longer on this unpleaſant ſtring, where I could ſhew, and it is known and felt, and ſmarted enough, what ignorance of the Tongue doth, or rather, what it doth not, but ſuffers. Come not and tell me tale of I know not what hard dealing of the people of <hi>Aſia</hi> and <hi>Africa.</hi> Beleeve me, they are as honeſt, as courteous, gracious, friendly, in alwayes as reſpectfull of you, as mindfull of you, tender to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards you, favourable, well faſhioned, as any the beſt Gentlemen in <hi>France, Spaine, Italie</hi> or <hi>Germa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nie,</hi> nay <hi>England</hi> it ſelfe. Have not ſo many vertues with you, nor ſo well made of body and minde, ſoule and heart, age and actions, if you lack this key of mens hearts, beleeve me, you will be weary before you can breake them open, for all that they would willingly give you an entrance into the moſt inward bowels of their good will. And if you cannot open them, it is not their fault, (for all men are but in this work paſſively wrought on not working) but yours; their vertues are as good as any mans, eaſily to be gained, but you are unskilfull.</p>

<pb n="32" facs="tcp:64385:29"/>that gracious and fruitfull <hi>Engliſh</hi> blood, rather than to deſtroy it and the Kingdome with civel warre, thereby to open the generall Worlds commerce at a more ſure and faſt tye, than hitherto, ſo that there may be leſſe troubles in <hi>England,</hi> which for the moſt part bud out of that ſuperfluous abundancy of the blood within the narrow veines of this Kingdome, ſo that men may be more generally imployed, laſineſſe being the Mother of all vices and devices againſt the Common-wealth and peace of this Kingdome. Or if that ſuch plantations ſhould be among ſuch people, whoſe tongue we doe not underſtand, and yet the profit be great in joyning with them, will theſe Tongues thinke you do hurt unto the State of <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land</hi> here or there? But let that ſleepe. Unto you moſt reverend and pious ſoules of <hi>England</hi> and <hi>Scot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi> unto you I would willingly ſpeake of that ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject, if I had leaſure, more largly and exactly, than this diſcourſe will afford. There are three things that concerne every one of what rank, condition, charge, honour, title or degree ſoever, and therefore I meane not onely the reverend Miniſters (though them truely more eſpecially) but you all in generall and I wiſh no man may thinke himſelfe not to be of that number.</p>
                  <p>Firſt, to have the truth at home, out of the well of truth and life (<hi>viz.</hi> the <hi>Ebrew</hi> Bible well and perfect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly underſtood without the help of any tranſlations whatſoever, whenſoever or by whoſoever compiled, excepting onely the <hi>Calde, Syriac, Samaritic,</hi> and <hi>Ethiopic</hi> tranſlations, they being the ſame with <hi>Ebrew</hi> the mother tongue it ſelf,) not out of broken ciſternes, where into breake in by force an infinity of dirt and mire.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, to have this truth tranſported in all our voyages great and ſmall, Eaſt and Weſt, even through
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:64385:29"/>the whole world, that is to take ſtill with you ſuch a man, as is able to ſatisfie you and your company with the ſweet and freſh water flowing from this well. <hi>viz.</hi> the <hi>Ebrew</hi> Bible, inſtructing you ſo farre therein that you may be an eye witneſſe of what he teaches, and ſo able to withſtand any gaineſayer: and to hold faſt that which your owne knowledge ſhewes you (out of the living fountaine of the <hi>Ebrew</hi> Bible) to be the undoubted truth, for you will ſcarcely finde this freſh and pure water in any Country (much leſſe at Sea) but onely in the innermoſt parts of <hi>Aſia</hi> and <hi>Africa</hi> (and there your ſhips arive not) ſo that you will be forced ſometimes to take in ſalt or brackiſh water of unſound tranſlations.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, If onely in the Eaſt Country <hi>viz Aſia</hi> and <hi>Africa,</hi> there be this well (<hi>viz.</hi> that tongue wherein the old Teſtament was delivered) and that generally throughout it; every City and village therein ſend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing it forth in plentifull ſtreames, ruſhing from them more abundantly, and ſtrongly, more cleare, pure, ſweet and taſtfull, than we can conceive; why ſhould not our youth (given to divine ſtudy) our young Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſters and Preachers, our young Gentlemen that would travaile for the good of their native Countrey, chooſe to go to thoſe places where this holy primitive tongue is as yet fully ſpoken, rather than towards <hi>France, Italy, Spaine</hi> or <hi>Germany,</hi> the <hi>Low countryes</hi> or any other of leſſe note, to quench their humerous fancyes with ſome <hi>Roman</hi> antiquities, having no life or ſalvation in them. Will not theſe conſiderations bring you back from a deceitfull opinion of thoſe a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bundant riches of your <hi>Engliſh</hi> ſtudyes, which hitherto have been more filled out of tranſlations, than the text it ſelfe: out of annotations of men, than your owne eye-ſight, to make you willing to trade more diligently by ſearching the fountaine it ſelfe, to ſee
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:64385:30"/>with your owne eyes, &amp; taſt with your owne tongue. I conſelfe I praiſe God Almighty from the very bottom of my heart &amp; ſoul, that ſuch riches have flowed out of thoſe halfe ſtopt wells, whereas by ignorance of the true nature of the tongues &amp; ſignification of the words in <hi>Ebrew, Calde,</hi> &amp;c. there is not a verſe in the Bible, but may be made more cleare &amp; plaine than hitherto; &amp; never a chapter in the Bible, wherein there are not very groſſe and foule faults even in the <hi>Engliſh</hi> tranſla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. Tell me not what other men did or doe know, but tell me what you know; not that others preach out of the text, but that you do it. It is not enough to ſay, <hi>In the</hi> Ebrew <hi>it is ſo &amp; ſo, it affordeth this or that ſenſe, doctrine, admonition, uſe, reproof, argument, connexion, disjunction, this or that number, gender and perſon, this or that larger explication, becauſe of the more large ſignifications of the words of my text;</hi> and that with a confidence, when for the moſt part all the auditors know, that it is but borrowed worke and onely upon heereſay, not from a true and judiciall knowledge many times not knowing ſo much as the names of the letters, much leſſe how to read: and your conſcience will tell you, that if the dawning hath ſuch a grace in your ſermons, the day light will be exceeding more gracious. Feare not, if our ignorance have done much good by other mens knowledge, but your know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge will do more. And therefore ſtir up your ſelves to ſuch a holy, neceſſary, ſweet, comfortable, living, ſpirituall good work. Let us not be drowſie, when Gods cals for labour and watching. Why will we ſleepe, when even the ſleep will bring us unto the danger of eternall plagues. A watchman muſt be vigi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lant, know the language of his Generall, be able to receive and give it, to diſcerne whither it be coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terfeited by an enemy, or the true Motto. All our vertues doe conſiſt in actions, not wiſhes. Would God,
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:64385:30"/>(you may ſay) I had learned it, when I was young. True, but now you are a Miniſter of it, ye muſt learne it, and that neceſſarily. When ye were young, you might have learned it, but now you muſt. Then was it eaſie, but now profitable; then delightſome, now reaſon will ſweeten it. Then would it have re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>commendeth your ingenium, but now your officium. Then memory was ſtrong, but now the pleaſure of God more tying. Then the knowledge or at leaſt the ſtudy of it would have bin honourable before men: but now is the ignorance ſhamefull. Then you did not underſtand it. But now ye do and ſee the ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſity. If ye did not learne it in your youth, you were, I am ſhure, careleſſe. But now not learning it, you are inexcuſable: nor age, nor reaſon, nor neceſſity, nor office, nor men, nor God, nay your owne conſcience can excuſe you. There is yet remaining an extraor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinary great uſe of this tongue, partly among learn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed men without any relation unto the learned in <hi>Aſia</hi> and <hi>Africa,</hi> partly in relation unto them, which is ſo large, that a great volume in folio might be filled up onely to that purpoſe, and that alſo with no ſmall profit to the Reader. But becauſe this is an Eſſay, it would be uncomely to make it to bigge, and unrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonable to take up the ſpace of remaining matters; and that uſe muſt cheefly be conſidered in this age, where ſome endeavour to make us thinke, that learn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing is cryed downe, which I never yet could beleeve, becauſe I find the contrary, and that if learn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing be not ſo richly ſet forth, the fault is elſewhere, and not where it is given out. Our laſineſſe ſpoiles us. Therefore breefly to ſay ſomething to that point. No ſtudie is ſweeter, than ſearch of nature. Now for the moſt part all the Authours that have ſearched nature formerly and in forraine parts, are written in <hi>Greek, Latine, Arabic</hi> and <hi>Ebrew</hi> among the <hi>Rabbines,</hi> in all
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:64385:31"/>of them is ſtill at this day an innumerable multitude of very fruitfull places, if they could be rightly un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtood. But becauſe they ſpeak of things, not pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perly belonging to, or extant in <hi>England</hi> but <hi>Aſia</hi> and <hi>Africa,</hi> and have written either in thoſe tongues, or termes, titles, names, deſcriptions, words or ſome phraſes of <hi>Aſia</hi> and <hi>Africa,</hi> what hope have you to learne the ful intent of the Authour, and to make profit of that place, Learned men know well enough that I might inſtance in hundreds of Authours, and in them many thouſands of things and words, which we underſtand not at this very day. Now the ignorant people will ſay, but alas, what helps us the knowledg of theſe things. Good people, thinke not, that what you cannot have within your deore at home, and ſee the profit of it there, if you ſee no precious ſtuffe (of good uſe partly to the publique good, partly for private ends and neceſſity) therefore no body be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides muſt have it? It may be you know not how to uſe Pepper, Ginger, Nut-megs, Cloves, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> ſhall therefore no body elſe uſe them? The greateſt part of all learning doth either mediatly or immediately flow unto theſe wholſome waters of the fountaine of life, the Bible and the underſtanding thereof. And becauſe it doth ſo, therefore honour I all learning, and ſo, although you cannot come ſo farre as to ſee the ruſhing of all learnings to the publique good, by a found and reaſonable interpretation of the Bible (be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fallen you by many impediments, <hi>viz.</hi> either by your ſloath, or your parents conceit or deceit) therefore I pray do not cavill at learning. For it will be as im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſſible for you, to breake downe that light, ſet up within the reaſon of a man, as to pul downe the ſun from the firmament, and to baniſh her out of the world. Nay if onely for one place of <hi>Iudea,</hi> for one <hi>Ieruſalem</hi> onely there muſt be learned <hi>Geographie,</hi>
                     <pb n="37" facs="tcp:64385:31"/>that moſt excellent art, whereby we know to divide the whole heaven and earth, according to reaſon, for quick and diſtinct apprehenſion of an orderly method as well of the ſtarres as countries, kingdomes, cities, and that great vaſt Ocean it ſelfe, with all the rivers from and towards it, if we will not live in this world as in a dungeon and dark priſon, but reaſonably to know where we are, where that Jeruſalem is ſituated, in the Scripture ſo much ſpoken of, and in what cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner of the world our Saviour ſuffered for our behalfe, I would thinke my labour or time very well beſtowed upon that art. How much more have we then reaſon to learne it, when in the Bible there are many hundred of places named, ſet downe, and deſcribed by the ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers, ſeas, adjacent neighbours, conſtitution of the nature of it, or ſome memorable paſſage thereabout, yet kept up by Gods providence and wiſe orderly government in the memory and relations of the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>habitants till this very day; when on the contrary without that arte almoſt nothing is rightly in the Bible underſtood. Yea for that arte we have need of this primitive tongue under the name of <hi>Arabic,</hi> there be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing yet many Arabic Geographers extant, for the moſt part not yet printed, and to be found in both Univerſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, here at <hi>London,</hi> and ſome noble Gentlemens Libra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries, which will afford an incredible bright ſhining ſun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beame unto that (as yet) very great darkeneſſe of our underſtanding, of the ſituation of places na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med in Scripture. So further, Aſtronomy, Geomerry, Muſick, and Arithmetick, ſo Logic, Rhetoric, Meta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phyſick, ſo the Ethic, Politic, Oeconomic, ſo Poeſie and all other Arts whatſoever, are honored, beautified, nobilitated and highly advanced by the Chriſtian faith, more than ever before in the heatheniſh Philoſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phers times, who did imbrace them more for curioſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty then Religion ſake, but we Chriſtians eſteeme them
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:64385:32"/>becauſe they willingly give all their aſſiſtance and of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer up their ſervice to the Bible and Divinity.</p>
                  <p>But further, if we would ſpeak of theſe artes in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference unto othermen, (<hi>viz.</hi> the greateſt part of thoſe in <hi>Aſia</hi> and <hi>Affrica</hi>) I avow that a more worthy work cannot be undertaken by a Generous Nation (as <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land</hi> I have experience of to bee) than that the Learned men thereof ſhould not only ſit ſtill at home (referring all things only to themſelves and ſtudies,) but alſo joyne with Heathens, Chriſtians, and Jewes, to learne from them, teach them, love them, and to be beloved of them, to meet them, invite, and doe them good, not only with temporall, but alſo (which they would accept of with more thankfull, humble, devout &amp; earneſt minds) with Spirituall refreſhments. Are you the worſe for having your Sermons frequen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted by thouſands more then formerly? or the Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>change with thouſands of Merchants more then your ſelves, every one of them encreaſing the common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wealth and riches of the City? or for having ſtore of ſpirituall, intellectuall, and corporeall goods, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with to refreſh all <hi>Aſia,</hi> and <hi>Affrica,</hi> by your writings, and inſtructions, in their owne tongue? but I muſt leave this (to me at leaſt) pleaſant muſic, and come to the fifth point, to ſhew, that theſe ſix languages, <hi>viz. Ebrew, Calde, Syriac, Samaritic, Ethiopic,</hi> and <hi>Arabic,</hi> are BUT ONE</p>
                  <p>Truly I would never have touched that point (ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther in this my Engliſh Eſſay, or in any of my latine books and writings) becauſe I know it is diſpleaſing to ſome, (who would not willingly heare the truth, or the nature and ſecrecy of this tongue diſcovered, or cannot believe it to be ſo, or if they doe, will not con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſe it, but would keep the people ſtill in ignorance &amp; admiration of unſpeakable high matters, whereunto no body is able to attaine, but themſelves; nay they
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:64385:32"/>thinke, that I undervalue the Holy tongue, feigning as if I ſpake of it in a contemptible way, becauſe of this unity (as if God were therefore to be contemned be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe BUT ONE) and that I looſe my owne repu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation of Learning, by writing and ſpeaking of it in that way of commendation. Some others are apt to thinke and ſay, that this ſort of commendation doth only ariſe out of ſome philoſophicall notions about unity and diverfity (which are alſo very uſefull and neceſſary) following therein <hi>Plato's</hi> wayes of diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſing of things rather in high, and witty fancies, than in plaine and ſamiliar way, tending to, and ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vancing the eaſines and utility of the matter under hand) but only that the truth muſt bee ſaid and written, much profit ariſing from a true notion of things (whole Kingdomes being willing to engage in a worke according to their notions be they good or bad) wherefore I thought it reaſonable to ſay ſomething in behalfe of this holy primitive tongue, when ſo many hundred wits lye and ſleep, out of a falſe conceit that it is impoſſible to overcome theſe O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rientall tongues, becauſe there is no end of ſtudying them, and never (almoſt) any ſeene to get out with credit and honour. Many thouſand wits otherwiſe imployed, that might eaſily be brought to any tongue, if they were well informed of the ſubject. Many thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand ſtudy not at all, that would be glad to have ſome good ſubject preſented them. In reſpect of all theſe, &amp; in love towards the rongue, I tender to all the Engliſh wits of whatſoever profeſſion, honour, title, degree, and ſtate, this ſort of learning, only with this condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, that they truly love God whom they ſee not, feare and tremble at his power and greatneſſe, yet withall faithfully embrace his mercy, kindneſſe, and goodneſſe, and rejoyce in the flouriſhing condition of their own Kingdome: for if they cannot doe this, I
<pb n="40" facs="tcp:64385:33"/>have done with them, and deſire not to engage farther with them. Upon this point, (<hi>viz.</hi> that all thoſe hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therto (though falſly) eſteemed divers tongues are but ONE) I did (partly) before build the uſefullneſſe, and ſhall hereafter alſo ſet downe the eaſineſſe of them, when I have fully demonſtrated that unity which I now ſpeake of.</p>
                  <p>Vnity then is a flower of eſſence, never of acci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dents, for they cannot have that prerogative to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come one, whereas let eſſence be preſented with all the various accoutrements that the wit of man can invent, it cannot be changed, but will alwayes remain one and the ſame. Now therefore when we ſpeake of the unity of theſe tongues, (<hi>viz.</hi> that theſe ſix tongues (in my opinion) <hi>are only one and not divers</hi>) it muſt be underſtood of their eſſence, not accidents. Ignorant people may thinke, that languages have nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther eſſence nor accidents, but the learned (and ſuch I ſpeake unto at this time (though in ſome meaſure to others alſo) know, that not only created matters, but alſo tongues, may be conſidered both in their eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence and accidents. And as eſſence is one, ſo hath it eſſentiall proprieties, <hi>viz. Vnity, Truth, and Good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe,</hi> beſides divers others: all which are ſo united with eſſence, or the eſſentiall being of things (meta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phyſically) conſidered, that if they are one and the ſame, it followes neceſſarily, that whatſoever is good and true in one, continues ſtill to be the ſame, under whatſoever climate, name, ſhape, or plantation it be found.</p>
                  <p>Then if <hi>Ebrew</hi> be good, holy, and primitive, and <hi>Caldaic, Syriac, Samaritic, Ethiopic,</hi> and <hi>Arabic</hi> (call them by as many names as you pleaſe) be the ſame primitive tongue: then if you deny, whether with, or without reaſon, any one of them, the name of pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitive, you may as well deny it to <hi>Ebrew</hi> it ſelfe,
<pb n="41" facs="tcp:64385:33"/>the denying of one being the denying of the other.</p>
                  <p>Now then I will lay downe the foundation of this unity. <hi>Ebrew, Calde, Syriac, Samaritic, Arabic, and Ethiopic, is one tongue, becauſe it hath but one matter and forme, whereof it conſiſts, and whereby it differs from all other tongues whatſoever, none of them having the ſaid properties.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The matter of theſe, <hi>viz. Ebrew, Calde, &amp;c.</hi> is 22. ſundry letters, (reduceable unto 20.) uſed generally by theſe people in all ages from <hi>David</hi> the King and Prophets dayes untill us. Nay further, ſeeing that <hi>David</hi> uſed the very ſame words which <hi>Moſes</hi> (the ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly penman of the five Bookes of the Law and ſtory of the patriarchs before the law,) both before and af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter the deluge (retayning the ſame nature that was obſerved by <hi>Ezra</hi> the Scribe) I thinke we have a good ground (from reaſon) to ſay that <hi>Adam</hi> himſelfe did uſe the ſame tongue.</p>
                  <p>But becauſe the antiquity of the <hi>Ebrew</hi> Alphabet (even from <hi>Adams</hi> dayes) is already ſufficiently de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monſtrated againſt any cavills, I ſhall goe on to ſhew my unity. Tis true, that there is ſome diverſity in the <hi>Arabic, Syriac,</hi> and <hi>Ethiopic</hi> Alphabet, though not ariſing from the tongue it ſelfe, but only that the <hi>Ethiopians,</hi> and <hi>Arabians</hi> (without any reſpect had to each other) do alter their Alphabet by changing their order and name, upon the authority and good liking of private men or teachers among their coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try men, but the <hi>Jewes</hi> keepe their order as they found it in the Pſalmes of <hi>David.</hi> Now whereas <hi>Ara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bic,</hi> and <hi>Ethiopic</hi> ſeemes to have many more Letters then <hi>Calde, Syriac, Samaritan,</hi> and <hi>Ebrew,</hi> it comes to paſſe onely by the addition of a point to note ſome ſmall diverſity of their pronunciation in ſome places. Yet becauſe that in the <hi>Ebrew, Galde,</hi> and <hi>Syriac</hi> al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo there is ſome ſuch point to be added unto ſo many
<pb n="42" facs="tcp:64385:34"/>letters, as by the <hi>Arabians</hi> (unto fewer by the <hi>Ethio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pians</hi>) not withſtanding not juſt the ſame, thence it comes to paſſe if ye will reckon up 22. <hi>Ebrew</hi> letters, and ſix of them with a point now and then added, you will make 28 letters, juſt as many as the <hi>Arabians</hi> have. And if from theſe 28 <hi>Arabic</hi> letters you will take off thoſe fix that are twice in the Alphabet, becauſe of one accidentall point more or leſſe, then you have 22 letters in <hi>Arabic</hi> alſo, no more nor leſſe. And that there is in <hi>Ebrew</hi> and <hi>Calde</hi> one letter more, than in <hi>Syriac</hi> and <hi>Arabic,</hi> even from thence it is eaſie to be obſerved, that that letter is but onely brought in by ſome accident, and was never at the firſt, nor eſteemed as a letter a part. The <hi>Etiopic</hi> Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phabet is in eſſence alſo the ſame with <hi>Ebrew;</hi> the names of the letters now and then changed doe not argue at all the changing of the tongue, <hi>Alf-Bet, Geml, Dent, Hoi, Vaw, Zai, Haut, Tait, Jaman, Caf, Lavi, Mai, Nahas, Savt, Ayin, Af, Zadai, Qaf, Res, Saat, Taui.</hi> Who ſees not theſe to be the very ſame letters deemed with <hi>Alef, Bet, Gimel, Dalet, He, Van, Zayin, Khet, Thet, Yod, Caf, Lamed, Mem, Nun, Shin, Ayin, Fe, Zadeh, Quf, Res, Sin, Tau,</hi> only that beſides theſe the <hi>Ethiopians</hi> have another <hi>Khet,</hi> as the <hi>Arabians</hi> have <hi>Ha</hi> and <hi>Kha,</hi> which they call <hi>Kharam,</hi> and ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther <hi>Tzadeh,</hi> as the <hi>Arabians</hi> likewiſe, cal'd <hi>Zappa;</hi> another <hi>Fe,</hi> pronounced <hi>P, Pait,</hi> and <hi>Pſ, Pſait;</hi> as al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo a ſurperfluous <hi>

                     </gap>talian, Spaniſh, French, and in ſome Engliſh words. Which additions are all but accidentall, not materiall. For is this part concerning the matter of the letters of the Alphabet enough to make it out, that theſe fix are but one tongue, there muſt bee the ſame forme
<pb n="43" facs="tcp:64385:34"/>alſo. For not withſtanding the <hi>Turkiſh, Perſian, Malaie, Mogul,</hi> great and leſſe <hi>Tatarian</hi> and <hi>Greeke</hi> tongues hath the ſame Alphabet, yet becauſe theſe tongues have not the ſame forme, therefore they are not the ſame with <hi>Ebrew.</hi> THREE OF ANY LEITER OF THE ALFABET MAKES A ROOT, FROM WHENCE COMES A NOUN AND VERB. So that as three the ſame letters found in divers tences, per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons, number and gender in ſundry places of the Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, yet for all that doe not make divers roots, but the ſelfeſame root remaines ſtill, ſo alſo the ſame let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters, if under ſome other accoutrement or faſhion under other names, ſhorter or bigger than in <hi>Ebrew,</hi> joyned or ſeperately written, are not for all that new letters, nor able to make a diverſity of roots, but on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly that one and the ſelfe ſame root without alteration. The ſignification or taſte of that root doth ſpread it ſelfe as well as the root unto the veth and nounes, and yet as the root is but one, ſo alſo is the radicall ſignification but one, and no more. This ſignification having the nature of the ſoule of the body, which con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſts of the matter and forme, cannot be but only one, becauſe the body being one, cannot have more ſoules to dwel within it, and one ſoule cannot dwel in two bodies; yea that one ſoule is able and active enough to doe and performe many thouſand actions by and in this body; ſo this ſignification is able to be active and extending it ſelfe into many matters and occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions, and ſhewes its vertues ſtill the ſame, and ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to the ſame effects, only proportionable, accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to the matter, and with a conſent. So that if there ſhould be found a thouſand Greek and Latine words, in one and the ſame <hi>Ebrew</hi> or <hi>Calde, Syriac</hi> or <hi>Arabic</hi> word, all theſe would, nor could ſhew a diverſity of ſignifications in the Orientall tongue, but an agreement among themſelves, and that a na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turall
<pb n="44" facs="tcp:64385:35"/>or radicall one of all theſe ſignifications how many ſoever, tending unto one and the ſame thing. And that has been the greateſt and hardeſt block whereon all the ſtrongeſt and moſt learned men did and doe ſtumble, to wit, at the diverſitie of the ſigni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fications, which at the firſt ſight were certainly ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny; and ſecondly, the ſame learned men lying in a dreame of divers Alphabets of <hi>Ebrew</hi> and the reſt, (as they ſpeake) of the Tongues, theſe two fancies did lead them to that judgment of divers tongues. Now as it is very true, that there is only one ſignifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation, becauſe only one root, one ſoule, becauſe only one body, not as a cauſe, but a ſigne of the number of ſoules; Yet the actions from one ſoule being di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers, have cauſed the Phyloſophers to make divers termes and titles of that ſoule; ſo is Rhetoric that Art, which ſhewes, by how many means a ſignificati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on in the root, may be divided, differenced, and di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſly applyed in divers members, and yet all this according to reaſon and nature, without any the leaſt wrong at all. And learned men know, how that in <hi>Ebrew</hi> it ſelfe many men have ſpoken unto that ſenſe, that every root of the <hi>Ebrew</hi> tongue hath only one radicall, effentiall, ideall, abſtract and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per ſignification: only that that one and neceſſary work was never yet done by any one. For if that had been once done, then would it never have made ſuch a great and hard task to undertake, that the ſame root in <hi>Ebrew</hi> and <hi>Arabic</hi> have one and the very ſame radical ſignification without changings, &amp; thoſe ſuch on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly as may be and are certainly and frequently in <hi>Ebrew</hi> it ſelfe. From this fundamentall Vnity, and eſſentiall Identity either of the root or ſignification, deſcends a double Vnity, firſt in things belonging to the words, which are Nounes and Verbs, in their matter and forme, ſecondly, in things belonging to their ſignifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation.
<pb n="45" facs="tcp:64385:35"/>Becauſe that the root is the ſame, therefore all <hi>Ebrew</hi> roots are <hi>Arabic, Ethiopic, Caldaic, Syriac,</hi> and <hi>Samaritic;</hi> and again, all the <hi>Arabic</hi> or <hi>Ethio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pic, Syriac, Samaritic,</hi> and <hi>Caldaic</hi> roots are <hi>Ebrew;</hi> whether extant in this or that book, in the <hi>Ebrew</hi> Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble or not, where I find the ſame letters, (becauſe letters make the root, and not the ſignifications;) whence it is that all the Dictionaries are ordered ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the Alphabet of the Letters, not accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to the ſignifications, therefore am I certain, and fully ſatisfied, that I have the ſame root, be it with the ſignification as it will, that ſhall and will be hereafter better ſeen and conſidered. So then <hi>Arabic</hi> roots are <hi>Syriac</hi> and <hi>Ethiopic</hi> and <hi>Ebrew</hi> roots, and the <hi>Arabic</hi> tongue is the <hi>Ebrew, Calde, Syriac, Samari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tic,</hi> and <hi>Ethiopic</hi> tongue, no diverſity at all under heaven in the ſubſtance and eſſence, only all the dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference is in accidents, and that ſmal too. And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by it ſollowes neceſſarily, that the Etymologie of all theſe falſly eſteemed divers tongues, is the ſame, to wit, all their derivations of Nounes and Verbs, Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons and Tenſes, which are not in the <hi>Ebrew</hi> Bible, I may take them out of <hi>Calde, Syriac,</hi> and <hi>Arabic,</hi> or <hi>Ethiopic,</hi> and write it with the <hi>Ebrew</hi> letters, and it is <hi>Ebrew,</hi> or <hi>Ebrew</hi> with <hi>Arabic</hi> letters, and it is <hi>Arabic.</hi> And thus have done all the <hi>Rabbines,</hi> and this is done in the <hi>Talmud,</hi> and ſo it is done in all <hi>Arabic</hi> Authors whatſoever, ſo that a fulneſſe of extant <hi>Ebrew</hi> Nounes and Verbs, and their divers forms, is not in the <hi>E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brew</hi> Bible, but in <hi>Calde, Syriac,</hi> and <hi>Arabic,</hi> with <hi>Ethi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>opie</hi> joyned and brought all together. Alſo all the Ana<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>logie or precepts for the forming of Nouns and Verbs in all Tenſes, Perſons, Numbers, Genders, in all reſpects are the ſame eſſentially and generally. So that from thence the <hi>Syntax</hi> comes to be the ſame <hi>Summa,</hi> from the Identitie of ſignifications, flowes the Identitie of
<pb n="46" facs="tcp:64385:36"/>phraſes in the Eſſence of theſe tongues, the ſame Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taphoros, Metonimys, Synecdoches and Ironies, or Contrarieties: Nay the ſame Poeſie to.</p>
                  <p>Upon this Vnity, I confeſſe, is built that Eaſineſſe, which is the ſixth and laſt point propounded, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by I dare ſay, that the Orientall tongues, to wit, on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly <hi>Ebrew, Calde, Syrias, Samaritic, Arabic,</hi> and <hi>Ethi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>opic,</hi> or to ſpeake more properly, that one and Holy Primitive Tongue is made more plaine and eaſie than hitherto it hath been. Notwithſtanding that <hi>Schind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ler,</hi> that worthy <hi>Schindler,</hi> my Countryman, whom all men preferre in point of judgment, before all the learn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed men in <hi>Europe,</hi> that ever medled with the Ori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>entall tongue, did much on that behalfe, and ſo much, as never any man before him, nor yet any other af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter him till this day, in finding out many hundreds of roots, to be the ſame in <hi>Ebrew, Calde, Syriac, A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rabic,</hi> or in the <hi>Rabbines.</hi> All which is excellently performed by him, yet he cheefely failes in foure forts of letters. <hi>Firſt,</hi> in the quieſcent letters, which he (with all the reſt of the Gramarians and Dictionary writers) ſeldome or never takes to bee but one in the root, though they are three or foure in the Alphabet: Yet doth he no leſſe than all the reſt, ſhew his reader ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny hundred times the way of one of them unto the other. <hi>Secondly,</hi> the greateſt and fouleſt fault he com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mits, is in confounding <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap>, whereby he con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>founds the root. <hi>Thirdly,</hi> he brings not all the <hi>Ara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bic, Galde,</hi> and <hi>Syriac</hi> ſuperfluous or wrong letters, to the right in the root, <hi>viz.</hi> when <hi>t</hi> in <hi>Calde</hi> and <hi>Syriac</hi> ſtands in place of <hi>ſ,</hi> which the <hi>Arabians</hi> (more curious and circumſpect in their writings) have con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantly marked with a point, and doe call it <hi>tſe:</hi> which in the root muſt not be brought to <hi>t,</hi> but to <hi>ſ,</hi> from whence it deſcends; and ſo alſo in <hi>th,</hi> deſcending from <hi>tz,</hi> the ſame care of pointing not being obſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved
<pb n="47" facs="tcp:64385:36"/>in the <hi>Galde</hi> and <hi>Syriac</hi> writing, that is in <hi>Arabic,</hi> which not conſidered, is falſly brought to <hi>th,</hi> when it belongs to <hi>tz:</hi> whereby alſo many falſe roots are made, and no ſmall confuſion cauſed. <hi>Fourthly,</hi> he brings many ſervil letters to be radical, whereas the firſt, ſecond, or third radical being caſt away, is compenſed by that ſervil, which then being miſtaken for a radical, doth extreamly confound the roots and their ſignifications. Notwithſtanding (waving all this,) becauſe he had that opinion of a co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>munity of tongues and dialects, and a neerneſſe ofſome ſweet agreement, he called his Dictionary <hi>Pentaglotton,</hi> of five tongues, to wit, <hi>Ebrew, Calde, Syriac, Arabic,</hi> and <hi>Rabbin</hi> or <hi>Talmudic</hi> tongue, as five divers dialects, and not as one naturall, corporall, materiall, undiſtinct, inſeparable body of one, to wit, eſſentially one tongue, therefore even with that title he ſpoiles the buſineſſe, and leaves in mens braines that opinion, which was before him, <hi>viz.</hi> that theſe tongues were of a neare kindred, and this he demonſtrated more clearly than any man in the world, but left as much buſineſſe to be done, and a better ground to be laid, than he himſelfe did find before him.</p>
                  <p>Now it is one worke to have found ſixe tongues to be the ſame in eſſence, only diſagreeing in ſome ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cidents; and another thing, to ſay they are divers tongues, though they come now and then ſomething neare one to another; as it were eaſie for me here to quote above two hundred teſtimonies of learned men, that did, and doe as yet ſpeake ſo. Whereas the contrary is moſt cleare, they making an analogall thing to be anomalicall, and an anomalicall, to bee analogall; in calling the black white, and whit black, ſweet ſower and ſower ſweet, day night, and night day, light darkeneſſe, and darkeneſſe light. Whereas <hi>Greek</hi> was never hitherto ſaid to be diſtinct from the <hi>Jonien,
<pb n="48" facs="tcp:64385:37"/>Attic, Doric</hi> and <hi>Aeolic</hi> tongues, and therefore States or Vniverſities did never ſettle divers profeſſours for them as we do for <hi>Ebrew Syriac</hi> and <hi>Arabic,</hi> &amp;c. So neither muſt it be thought, that theſe are divers tongues, but only one. Profeſſours of them, I wiſh in every Vniverſity rather to be TEN, than ONE, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe of the fulnes of work, that diligent hands will finde therein.</p>
                  <p>Now then only one Grammar, for all theſe tongues, one Orthography in eſſentiall things, to wit, the eſſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiall figure of the characters of Ebrue, (Calde) Sama<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritic, Syriack and Arabic, and the greateſt part of the Ethiopic, is the ſame. One Analogy or precepts and ground rules for the ſyntax, one etymology or Dictionary; one ſyntax through all, and one proſodia on poeſie. All whatſoever is done in behalfe of Ebrue, is done at the ſame inſtant in all the reſt. So much as yee know in Ebrew and have learnt, and do learn there, keep it well, becauſe, (if it be true and eſſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiall of the tongue,) you have not need to learne it againe in <hi>Arabic</hi> and <hi>Syriac.</hi> So that whatſoever yee obſerve in one, the ſame, if true and eſſentiall, you will meete withall in the other. The <hi>Arabic</hi> tongue will do as much (nay more) good to the underſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of the Ebrue Bible, then all the <hi>Rabbines</hi> or the <hi>Talmud</hi> it ſelfe, they being all ſprung up but of late yeares? And comming farre ſhort of the affinity that is betwixt the <hi>Ebrew</hi> Bible and the <hi>Arabic</hi> tongue. In many things Chriſtians go far beyond them all, as in matter of <hi>Logic, Rhetoric, Metaphyſiek, Divinity, Grammar, Arithmetic, Geometry, Aſtronomy, Geogra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phy, Ethics, Politicks</hi> and <hi>Phiſick;</hi> in matter of ſtories and deſcriptions of Cities, Countries, and any other thing whatſoever. Whereby I do freely profeſſe, that we have but ſmall hope to learne great matters from them, yet becauſe they are our eldeſt brethren, wee
<pb n="49" facs="tcp:64385:37"/>muſt learn to lead them out of their rotten wayes, unto our Soveraine and Redeemer <hi>Jeſus Chriſt.</hi> And whereas they are a ſtubborne people, ſtifnecked, and not eaſily yeelding unto things differing from their parents and anceſtors Creed, therefore is it very needfull to ſtudy thoroughly all their books, and to marke out all the beſt paſſages, whereby the blind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe of the living <hi>Iewes</hi> may be taken away by the Medicines found in Records of their own anceſtors; It is otherwiſe with <hi>Arabic</hi> and <hi>Ethiopic,</hi> (the lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guage of the <hi>Inhabitans</hi> of <hi>Africa</hi> and <hi>Aſia</hi>) with which people were we once well acquainted, it would do us more profit and pleaſure to be taught by them their old ſecrets, then we them, by teaching our Arts and Sciences.</p>
                  <p>For Chriſt is known among the <hi>Aboſſins</hi> or <hi>Ethiopians,</hi> they being for the moſt part Chriſtians; And <hi>Ara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bians</hi> notwithſtanding they are for the moſt part <hi>Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racens</hi> or <hi>Turks,</hi> (believing by the way of <hi>Mahomed</hi> one God, one in eſſence and perſon,) yet have they many hundreds of Chriſtian-churches or pariſhes among them. And they would ſtand admiring, when they ſhould ſee that another people, which they never heard of (a fine white, gracious, beautifull people) know their tongue, can read their writings, and is willing to impart them thouſands of <hi>Arabic</hi> books, which they never ſaw, or heard of before, and them printed in a far remote Kingdome, onely out of love towards them, to ſhew them a fuller light, to impart them their libraries gotten unawares from them, whilſt they did ſleepe. All this would bring them unto the love of our Saviour.</p>
                  <p>Beſides, the method in the Grammar, is brought to a farre more eaſie and near way even by this, that accidentalls are ſeparated from the eſſentiall parts, which hetherto have bin confuſedly treated of in
<pb n="50" facs="tcp:64385:38"/>divers parts of ſpeech, by the leaſt <hi>three,</hi> by others <hi>eight</hi> or <hi>nine,</hi> by me onely under a Noun and Verb, as in nature is onely day and night, white and black, light and darkneſſe. And whereas the greateſt dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficulties for the <hi>Ebrew</hi> bible has been in the finding of the root of any word by an unskilfull beginner of the Grammer (ſo that they did learn two, foure, eight or ten years this tongue, out of divers Authors, by divers Grammarians, ſtill in another new method, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe of thouſands of <hi>Anomalies,</hi> and rules, diverſly either framed, delivered or ſcattered, few of them being the ſame in all Authors, many ſpeciall rules or obſervations being ſet down as generall, and generals ſlighted as common and ſpeciall ons, without triall whither there were any uſe of it or not, never enqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring whither needfull in Syntax, never almoſt with reaſon, onely upon beliefe, ſo ſayes this and that man, yet they never became true Maſters:) which ſo far forth as a mans ſtudy can and Gods mercy will afford ſhall be taken away in an <hi>Ebrew</hi> Engliſh Dixio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary, which is to follow.</p>
                  <p>If the eaſineſſe of things in the tongue be naturally (and in it ſelfe) greater than hitherto thought, and if by men who would willingly ſee the glory of the Goſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pell of Chriſt duly and truly ſet forth, and have there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore indeavoured (by all their meanes and power, waving their owne occaſions, and divers callings to an other worke, wherewith the world would have been better pleaſed) to advance that learning, which hath as it were in its boſome the hidden ſecrets and counſell of God more unfainedly cloſed up, why ſhould than all this be ſpoiled with the wayes of teaching, or learning them? Teaching requires a love unto the worke as well as to the perſon? The worke is from God, who would never have ſet us on a hard taske for our ſalvation, or at leaſt, not harder than wee
<pb n="51" facs="tcp:64385:38"/>are able to beare with all. God ſpeakes in an eaſy and plaine way, in ſuch ſort of ſpeeches, as the moſt inward friends to uſe one to another. God is truly popular in his deliverance, and his word is plainly to be un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtood. It is the fault of the interpreters, that there are now ſo many commentators extant on the bible. If they did ſet downe thoſe eaſy and plaine words in their tranſlations, that they finde to ſurniſh their commentaries with all, there would be no need of ſuch ſort of commenting.</p>
                  <p>But they give the words in the tranſlations not ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording as their owne naturall and reaſonable judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment or underſtanding doth clearly dictate, but ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the Dictionaties; which having but few fignifications, the Authors thereof not being able, or willing, at leaſt conceiving it needleſſe to give many, nay if many be given, the life of the worke being in the choyce of the beſt and moſt qualified ſignificati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, but that not being done it comes to paſſe that the Text is made obſcure, and people led with an opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion of the difficulty of this tongue. The ground of this fear hath been and is yet, and for ought I know, will be ſtill ſo, as long as there are not able men ſet on the work, (things being as yet but taken upon truſt.) I may ſay it without heſitation, that the <hi>Greek</hi> tranſla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion (which was drawne from the <hi>Ebrew,</hi> and from thence the Latin, from whence almoſt all the <hi>Eureo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pean</hi> tranſlations) hath ſpoyled all our interpreters whatſoever. They ſaw many things to be different and thoſe made them begin to doubt, their owne hearts began to ſhew them ſome occaſions to finde out the truth of many places, but the tranſlations extant before hand did dazle and corrupt their judgements, ſo that when they ſhould ſee with both eyes to the <hi>Ebrew</hi> Bible, they (for the moſt part) upon ſome for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer
<pb n="52" facs="tcp:64385:39"/>tranſlations eſpecially upon that w<hi rend="sup">ch</hi> had then the name of the beſt, did doote. If they had never looked on the <hi>Greec</hi> nor <hi>Latin,</hi> but had ſtudied earneſtly one or two years the <hi>Ebrew,</hi> and than fallen on the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terpretation of the bible, it had bin better.</p>
                  <p>Now that being neglected, darkneſſe comes into the tranſlations; which being ſpied and obſerved thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſands of doubts ariſe, making every one deſire to have them mended, but few are found to bee able (and that's no wonder) ſeeing the Univerſities teach this kinde of learning as if it weare rather for ornament than uſe, for pleaſure than neceſſity, for plea, than fighting; becauſe Kings, Parliaments, Magiſtrates, and Miniſters, do not ſtand cloſe to the true reformati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the church, and removall of all Helliſh ſeed ſowne unawares by the Devill, not onely by night (when the watchmen ſleepe) but even at noone day; taking the opportunity of the watchmens careleſſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe: he being very diligent to take all opportunities to ſow the ſeeds of darkneſſe into the hearts and opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nions of men, concerning this holy tongue, not being able to ſet any ſpots upon the tongue it ſelfe.

For from the right, and convenient explication of the context doth depend all the meanes to draw forth any dogmaticall point of Divinity and all ſorts of diſputations, exhor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tations, and conſolations, commonly uſed by the helpe of thoſe which we ordinarily call common places.

                  </p>
                  <p>But O good <hi>Beza!</hi> who believes thy preaching and admonitions? I confeſſe, ſometimes upon a ſuddaine fit a humerous minde will looke into the <hi>Ebrew</hi> bible, to ſee what word is there to brag with in the pulpit; but no body talkes of a generall reformation in the Church, Vniverſities, and Schooles. <hi>Quaerenda pecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nia primum; Deus poſt nummes: Firſt mony, and then God.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>There is neither love to teach, nor love to learne: 'tis a wonder to ſee what a drowfineſſe is in our very Schollers. All things of God go on with a ſlow and
<pb n="54" facs="tcp:64385:40"/>heavy pace, as if hee were not worthy of the beſt entertainments of our thoughts; but I am ſure God will once meet with them.</p>
                  <p>Therefore <hi>curteous Reader</hi> I beſeech thee hearti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, and (with my moſt humble, deep and affectionate defire) tender unto thee, that thou wouldſt be plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed to be truly ſenſible of that high and unſpeakable contempt of Gods word, even by thoſe that live by it; give good counſell, help, admoniſh, inſtruct, act, ſtir, nay in ſome meaſure, if thou haſt power in thy hand (as now 4 or 500 able men have) be vigorous, ſet Schollers truly on worke, and let them not be ſquan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dring away their time, whither in, or out of the Vniverſity, in Scholes, or out of them, in a Miniſtry or out of a Miniſtry, in a publique calling, or not yet called; If they will have any incouragements from the publique, from the Altar, from pious and chari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table gifts, houſes, dwellings, or revenues; I pray let them throughly work for it.</p>
                  <p>Now when the water of a generall deluge hath ſpoyled all Piety in actions, wee are all become ſo full of worldly care that the firſt word wee ſpeake in the Church is, <hi>what newes?</hi> as ſoone as the Sermon is en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded, they aske, <hi>what heare you?</hi> And thus gets the Devill away that pretious ſeede, which ſhould grow up in our hearts and beare fruit in patience and long ſuffering. I wiſh that Miniſters would give their mindes leſſe to the reading of the dayly newes, and more to Gods Word, Worke, Tongue, Church and choſen, and beſtowe that money (which they uſually ſpend upon ſuch trifles) upon the poore, and left all the care of ſtate affaires unto the Parliament, them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves fighting onely with prayers, and almes deedes, (wherewith they might finde worke enough) and teach others to do good by their examples, and good works;
<pb n="55" facs="tcp:64385:40"/>O! what a fine ſunſhine would ariſe and break forth in the midſt of theſe clouds. I beſeech the Miniſters as they will anſwer it at the laſt day, that they will not any more ordaine ſuch men, as know not Gods Tongue. And if that moſt reverend order of men cannot finde it within their hearts to do this ſo ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary a thing, then beſeech I the Magiſtrate, (hee that weares not the ſword in vaine) to uſe his autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity, and to provide that there may not be any men ordained, let him have never ſo many callings (poor people know not many times what they would have, what is good for them, whither, what is recommen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded to them, bee good or bad) except bee bee able to make good his profeſſion (out of the <hi>Ebrew</hi> and <hi>Greec</hi> tongue in the old and new Teſtament) againſt a Jew. And truly to that purpoſe I could wiſh our Magiſtrats would let them come amongſt us, to be taught by us more cloſly at home, and to rouſe and awaken our drouſie and ſleepy ſpirits, which be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe they have nothing to do, apply themſelves, ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther to do hurt than good. God knowes I pray them, I pray for them, I am willing to teach, willing to of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer all my ſtrength, but alas within one year, weeke after weeke, labour after labour, of 300 or 400 Schol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lars, learned men, and Preachers, now, and then in the city, I dare not ſay how few I find to be zealous of gods glory, &amp; how many unaſhamed of their filthy &amp; ſink<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing nakednes before many men that can diſcern it wel enough. But becauſe the Magiſtrate looketh not nar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rowly into mens actions, whither good or bad juſt or unjuſt, whither the laborious be rewarded and idly puniſhed, worthy or unworthy ordained; it comes to paſſe that all things are at ſo ill a paſſe.</p>
                  <p>The eaſineſſe of teaching and propagating the Goſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pell of God by this tongue conſiſts in thoſe ſeverall
<pb n="56" facs="tcp:64385:41"/>things which I wil heer ſet down not as a Logician, but a willing afforder of what I conceave fit for profeſſors.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Firſt,</hi> let him pray to God, to ſhew him the neareſt way, and God, as he is able, ſo is hee willing to do it. And I am ſure, that ſuch a man, who doth pray to God inceſſantly within the chamber of his heart, to direct him in his wayes for eaſineſſe, God will finde him ſuch a way, as no other man thought on before.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Secondly,</hi> let him but love his worke, have his de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>light in it, view it moſt diligently, even into the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nermoſt part of it, and hee will diſplay a greater eaſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe, than he is aware of.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Thirdly,</hi> let him love his diſciples heartily and ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derly, and then I am either utterly miſtaken, or elſe he will give unto them all poſſible explications of the things under hand, and will diſcuſſe all the doubts they are able to propound.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Fourthly,</hi> let him thirſt after more knowledge, after more good and ſound reaſon, being certaine of that, becauſe God is the knowledge it ſelfe, therefore how much knowledge hee gets, the greater appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>henſion of Gods wonders and mighty infinity, and infinite wiſdome; by whoſe workes he will finde out wayes to teach his Schollers more eaſily.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Fifthly,</hi> let him labour willingly, not being forced, not ſubdued and oppreſſed by ſome ſuperiours, as be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing certaine, every time when hee doth worke, hee makes himſelfe fitter to teach, and the worke eaſier for him, and the Schollar more diſpoſed towards the work, and himſelfe, which is the eaſineſſe.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Sixthly,</hi> let him never expect, till he be called, but begin to teach in private firſt, then afterwards in publique before hee be called, ſtriving every day to ſhew himſelfe as willing minded to do the worke, as if the whole Kingdome had called him, and having
<pb n="57" facs="tcp:64385:41"/>his heart ſtill in a willingneſſe to worke, if the State would deſire his ſervice, as deſerving it, not getting it for money.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Seventhly,</hi> let him go ſtill further, than hee was deſired. If to read but once, let him do it twice. For as all other great and mighty workes muſt not be done with a tedious toyle ſomneſſe, but with an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtancy and purſuance of the matter, and that the more violent, the leſſe it ſuffers any delay, ſo truly he muſt have his deſires to do good increaſing by truſt, that thereby he may act more good, becauſe more free.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Eighthly,</hi> let him thinke and be perſwaded, that God will have him do good not onely unto a few Auditours, but even unto the whole Kingdome of <hi>England.</hi> He may truly believe, and I am ſure he has the warrant of Gods Word and his owne conſcience for it; that he doth not amiſſe in teaching <hi>Ebrew</hi> and this holy tongue even to the moſt common ſort of people. His Kingdome doth not conſiſt in meat and drinke, not in that or this great and wiſe, or low and deſpicable man, but in the power of the will of God revealed in his word (in his own tongue) towards all and every ſoule.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Ninthly,</hi> let him love the Miniſters of the word of God and all pious and Chriſtian ſoules with a tender and hearty love, and honour them with all his ſtrength, minde, affection, expreſſions, actions. But with a fatherly love, knowing that hee has ſo many ghoſtly ſons to be inſtructed, who ſhall further inſtruct o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers; and the eaſineſſe of the worke will be ſeene more fully and clear.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Tenthly,</hi> let him have an undaunted ſpirit againſt all oppoſers in that way of learning, being ſure of that, except there bee no God at all, and all this called Gods Word, to be a meare tale, and his tongue to be unexpreſſable in <hi>Engliſh</hi> (all which may be the
<pb n="58" facs="tcp:64385:42"/>thoughts and ſpeeches of wicked Atheiſts;) hee will truly aſſiſt him, adde to him ſtrength to ſtrength, joy in the ſpirit, eaſines to eaſines, advance to profit, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifit, and much good in the Church and Common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wealth, and will make him a bleſſing and not a curſe, to his time and following ages.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Eleventhly,</hi> let him not onely be willing to teach privately and publickly, but alſo to give in print his thoughts and learning, that wherſoever hee cannot reach with his voice, he may reach with his Pen. God bleſſes thoſe that uſe their tongue and pen for the profit of Church and Common-wealth, and not for the diſgrace and diſhonour, or tending to the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruction thereof. It is very needfull to have a mind to write as willingly, faſt, and carefully, as to teach heartily. For otherwiſe he cannot ſtirre up ſo many drowſie ſpirits, if hee will not awake them by the trumpets of his holy alarm.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Twelfthly,</hi> let him read good Authors, which have laboured before him, with all tenderneſſe, to obſerve how farre they have brought the worke, unto what eaſneſſe, if there can be added, yea or no, without any detraction of their labours, with a thankfull heart: and if hee knowes of any ſuch, who are truly profit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able, and have bin ſo to him, let him give notice of it, that many mens paines may eaſe the work.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Thirteenthly,</hi> and yet if the very ground worke be rotten, or if it may be ſuſpected to be ſo, becauſe that almoſt in all parts of learnings the cauſe and reaſon of unſound proceedings in ſtudies, lies at the roote, ground and foundation of the worke, let him make clear before all things that place to himſelfe &amp; others, and than he may build upon it with an eaſines.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Fourteenthly,</hi> let him have ſtill in mind his reaſon, that nothing muſt be done, ſpoken or taught with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out it; and ſtill direct his heart, to finde out the
<pb n="59" facs="tcp:64385:42"/>reaſon of the things, he teaches or is taught, to deſire and ſearch, if by Authors reaſon is given for that or this thing. Being certaine, that nothing makes things eaſier, than that golden beam of that gracious Sun within our ſelves REASON. And therefore muſt hee be skilled in theſe Arts, that teach to uſe it well, and deſire it may be inlightned and not obſtructed, and to worke by reaſon unto his Schol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lers.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Fifteenthly,</hi> let him ſtill ſhew to every one of his diſciples and cauſe them to conſider, whither it be poſſible and reaſonable or not, that ſuch a little book as the <hi>Ebrew</hi> Bible ſhould be difficult to be learned, nay, not to be learned in a ſhort time: eſpecially, when out of our tranſlations wee have already given unto us the contents of every Booke, Chapter, and Verſe: whereby it is impoſſible, (if we will but read the <hi>Ebrew</hi> conſtantly and diligently,) conſidering ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tionally, how we in ſuch and ſuch a matter uſe to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſse our minds; either I am utterly deceived, or in the moſt part of the Bibell our own wit will lead us ſo, that all people ſhall agree in it, and ſhall not, nor may deem it fancies. In the reſt wee muſt go to this holy tongue.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Sixteenthly,</hi> let him never be led out of the whole ſtore of Gods proviſion, that is, out of this whole tongue <hi>Ebrew, Calde, Samaritic, Syriac, Arabic</hi> and <hi>Etiopic,</hi> as if he might do well enough in learning only <hi>Ebrew,</hi> or at the higheſt <hi>Ebrew</hi> and <hi>Calde;</hi> being certaine, that that notion is no more reaſonable, than as if a man would be able to expound the firſt Chap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of <hi>Moſes</hi> in <hi>Ebrew,</hi> if hee never had any <hi>Ebrew</hi> more than occurres in that Chapter. For as hee his great need of all the <hi>Ebrew,</hi> that is in the whole bible, nay more to, than there is in the <hi>Ebrew</hi> Bible, how much more then will there be a neceſſity of all and
<pb n="60" facs="tcp:64385:43"/>the whole tongue to underſtand ſo many thouſand paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſages, which are yet to be cleared up.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Seventeenthly,</hi> let him not onely wiſh, but labour to get TEN or TWENTY more labourers with him, and if it be poſſible, more rare and choyce men; then himſelfe. Let him be the ableſt, moſt diligent, rare, painfull, pious, humble, meeke, courteous, free and loving ſpirit; yet wiſh and pray heartily to God and the Magiſtrate, to ſet downe with him many la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bourers more, and if he can heare, eſpy, and procure ſuch as are farre tranſcending him, let him rejoyce in that, as a ſpeciall bleſſing of <hi>God</hi> Almighty.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Eighteenthly,</hi> let him never forget the poore Bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren in other Countries under the perſecutions of forraigne States, within or without the Church. If any meanes may be procured, whereby we ſhall not mock God Almighty any more unto his face, praying for them, and yet ſtirring not a hand or foot to helpe them, but will worke and become working in good earneſt for thoſe Chriſtians in <hi>Aſia</hi> and <hi>Africa;</hi> let him move or beſeech the Magiſtrate, or at leaſt un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der hand worke out by friends or whoſoever by the States, that they may not be any more unſenſible of the unmeaſurable want of their brethren. The <hi>Germans, Frenchmen, Spaniards, Italians, Low Duchmen,</hi> nay all ſorts almoſt of the <hi>Europians</hi> have helpt <hi>England</hi> by affording us the <hi>Ebrew</hi> Bibell and other books in great abundance. Let us ſee now if we can at length be thankfull towards them, returning good for good: or in doing good with printing thouſands of <hi>Ebrew, Calde, Syriac, Arabic,</hi> and <hi>Etiopic,</hi> Bibels; thereby to give as plentifully Gods Word to <hi>Aſia</hi> and <hi>Africa,</hi> as by the mercy of God we have it in <hi>England.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Ninteenthly,</hi> nay let him truly defire the converſion of the <hi>Muhammedans,</hi> who are as neere Chriſtians, as many others are which beare the name of Chriſt, <hi>viz.
<pb n="61" facs="tcp:64385:43"/>Photinians, Arrians,</hi> halfe <hi>Arrians, Socinians, Wei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gelians, &amp;c.</hi> which I ſet down under their ſeverall names, although their ſects are rather one than more, when they will not ſuffer Chriſt, (who came into the fleſh of <hi>Adam,</hi> and did take upon him the ſeed of <hi>Adam</hi> and not of <hi>Angels,</hi>) to be God and the Sonne of God, wherein the <hi>Turkes</hi> come neareſt unto them. Some good way ſhould be laid downe by all meanes for them alſo, who would bring in a great ſtore of Churches and of a moſt flouriſhing beauty, if once brought to the true acquaintance with the Goſpel of Chriſt. The fault lies not in them ſo much as in us; wee can helpe, but are laſy and deſire it not.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Twentieth,</hi> The converſion of the <hi>Iewes,</hi> for whom I hear every weeke ſo earneſtly prayed, and yet ſee nothing leſſe endevoured, muſt bee one point of any chriſtian teacher of Gods Word; What? all to neglect the converſion of thoſe people, which in Gods eye are ſtill beloved, becauſe under the rod. I pray, let us not trample upon them, but have mercy on them. Fy for ſhame, A chriſtian, and a deſpiſer of Gods counſell. Are mens wayes ſo much towards goodneſſe, that they will and can forgive their ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies, and ſhould God not deale ſo with his creatures? Hee whoſe wayes are higher than our wayes, and whoſe thoughts heigher than our thoughts. Even that is a ſigne to me of Gods grace towards a <hi>Iew,</hi> becauſe God ſtirres up ſo many chriſtian Miniſters to pray for them. I heere it moſt conſtantly in <hi>Pauls London</hi> Or are they all deceived men. Are they all praying for a thing, which God has never deſired or decreed? I never heare any of them to pray for the Divell that he may be ſaved, and there is no body hath any thing to plead for him, nay not ſo much as ignorance, hee knowes well enough Jeſus, to be the Chriſt and Son
<pb n="62" facs="tcp:64385:44"/>of God they knew him, and therefore did they them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves acknowledge him. I beſeech you heartily, when you pray for the Jewes converſion, doe you it only out of faſhion, or with your very earneſt de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire? If out of faſhion? O ye wicked Hypocrite! If out of an hearty deſire, why then ſo ſlow? And if we never had any promiſe of their converſion in the New Teſtament (whereof yet we have abundant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly) ſhould they not be as good unto us as the Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thens? Had not the Jewes a promiſe of our (which were Heathens) converſion? They had, and God has done it; (bleſſed be his name for ever;) and no doubt will doe it with the Jewes alſo.</p>
                  <p>There is another ſort of eaſineſſe of this Orien<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tall tongue, (for thoſe I ſpake of even now, I con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſe are vertues belonging to a profeſſour, and ſuch as will facilitate any profeſſion whatſoever, not only of tongues, leſſe only Orientall) taken out of the very bowels of it, <hi>viz.</hi>

                  <p>
                     <hi>Firſt,</hi> becauſe it is the eldeſt or primitive, and conſequently the moſt ſimple tongue, as God the firſt founder and giver of it, is the ſimplenes or ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gleneſſe it ſelfe; and as <hi>Adam</hi> (the firſt ſpeaker of it) in his ſtate of innocence (when it was given him) was the moſt true and ſimple Grammarian, Rhe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>torician, Logician, and Metapyſician that lived in the world and church, from whence it begun and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinues till our dayes: whether its glory did ever in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſe or decreaſe, I know not; ſure I am, that then it was in its higheſt ſphere. Yet as all other tongues doe not increaſe and decreaſe, ſaving only in the fan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies of men; So neither could it be brought to a confuſion at the confuſion of Babel, (which Authors improperly expreſſe, <hi>viz. It did eſcape without ruine</hi>) nor at the captivity of Babel, which was of a farre leſſe miraculous power of God from heaven, having
<pb n="63" facs="tcp:64385:44"/>no need of repairing after either of both, nor fal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling far ſhort from former perfection: as out of na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turall grounds, (which hereafter will be laid down) may appeare. This ſingleneſſe is ſeen in many things. Firſt, in a conſtant Trinunity (repreſenting the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of its author) in having for a union to a root, a trinity of letters: for a unity of a conjugation, a trinity of tenſes: for a unity to a tenſe (of things paſt or to come) a trinity of perſons: for a unity of one letter in the root, a trinity of <gap reason="foreign">

It becomes eaſie becauſe of its <hi>rationality</hi> in all things, whereof we had already many paſſages before: but here is obſervable that infinite wiſedome and depth of reaſon in every ſignification of the root communicated to a great variety of Nounes and Verbs, and yet all theſe (as by the outward ſhape of the Analogy) turning about their one and only center the root, thoſe three radicall letter, ſo that
<pb n="64" facs="tcp:64385:45"/>the ſignification of them all winde themſelves ratio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nally out, reflecting unto that radicall ſignification, as a ſwarm of bees goe out and returne to their ſtock.</p>
                  <p>And thirdly, becauſe in nature there is no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing in vaine, it becomes eaſie by its <hi>
                        <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>niverſality</hi> or <hi>Generality</hi> of matters, that whereas there are 8000 roots, and as many fignifications, which doe order<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly follow according to the Alphabet, depending upon one another without interruption, it being im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſſible that any ſhould be entered or taken out without the diſſolution of the naturall chaine; ſo al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo doe thoſe things hang together which they ſigni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fie; ſo that in the ſignification of thoſe 8000. roots is contained, <hi>nature</hi> and <hi>idea,</hi> or, <hi>compoſitions</hi> and <hi>ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtractions, phyſic</hi> and <hi>metaphyſic,</hi> and doe orderly depend one upon another, and their naturall depen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence to be not onely demonſtrable, but already demonſtrated by this holy primitive tongue, if lear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned men will hereafter open their eyes, and uſe their reaſon. Whereby we ſhall be able to find out many things, the cauſes whereof we ſearch and cannot find, (notwithſtanding they are extant in the radicall ſignification of the root from whence they are derived) ſo that I perſwade my ſelfe, the only way of a naturall ſearch of hidden things about their cauſes, dependences, connexions, ſeparations, proportions, degrees, inlightnings, obſcurenes, &amp;c. <hi>a priori,</hi> not <hi>a poſteriori,</hi> (which way is very uncer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain and toylſom, and yet hitherto only followed by all the Univerſities, and ſo by many millions of witty men, as I conceive, out of a righteous judgment of God Almighty, pronounced againſt them for the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt of his word and tongue) is only extant in this holy tongue, and not elſewhere, let men ſeek it where they will: whereas if they had returned to Gods gift and way, they would have found if

                  <p>
                     <hi>Fourthly,</hi> Eaſie becauſe of its <hi>Abſtractions</hi> ſutable to mens ſpirits. As all theſe 8000. roots orderly bud out of 20. ſeverall letters of the Alphabet, ſo that the Alphabet is the <hi>primum mobile,</hi> or the firſt moving cauſe of all thoſe 8000. roots, and of their, it may be, 80000. nounes and verbes; (and by them are expreſſed all things in heaven and earth expreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſable and revealed to us;) So that now as all the words and nouns are reduceable unto 20. fundamentall co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lumnes; ſo alſo all things are reduceable not only to thoſe 8000. radicall and ideal ſignifications, but thoſe alſo unto 20. columnes of the higheſt abſtra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions (the Metaphyſicians ſpeak alſo of an abſtra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction <hi>major</hi> and <hi>minor,</hi> bigger or leſſe in ſome mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure analogall hereunto) of things. And whereas many of theſe things, nay almoſt all are not under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtood hitherto, I know not where the fault lyes, (unleſſe it be in three letters, <hi>viz.</hi> SIN.) Foraſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>much as my reading can afford me, I am ſure, and can make it good againſt all oppoſers (which I ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe will be only younglings in learning, and not wiſe or learned men:) that this ſelfe ſame worke has been ſtill deſired among Chriſtians and Jewes; the Philoſophers have uſed their reaſon, but not in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lightned by Gods word and tongue, nay they ſcorn tongues (I wiſh they would cut out their owne, and then try what they are able to ſay for themſelves) pretending they ſtudy <hi>realities.</hi> The <hi>Philolegers,</hi> or thoſe that found in the tongues an admirable light, uſe and neceſſity, doe ſcorne the Philoſophers, as know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, they cannot but prove ill husbands of their time, reaſon and labour, having found by experience this principle to be in the tongues, <hi>viz. Verba eſſe ſigna rerum, the words to be the characters of things.</hi> Where both ſhould labour together, and Philoſophers be
<pb n="66" facs="tcp:64385:46"/>Philologers, and both be one. And if this were done, all ſtudies would go better, and how higher ariſing, the more deſiring of HEAVEN.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Fifthly,</hi> it becomes eaſie by its <hi>Vivacity</hi> or live<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lyneſſe even at this very day. Nothing is ſo bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thenſome as lead, gold, &amp;c. becauſe they have no aire, ſpirit, life nor lightſomeneſſe in them (though the wit of man makes them fly high enough:) for where there is life, there is a lifted motion, and <hi>leaven</hi> is ſo cald, becauſe lifting it ſelfe up by that ſpirit of life within it. Then, where any thing proves to have a vivacity, life, or livingnes, there is a cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine argument of an eaſie handling of it. <hi>This tongue is not dead, but it lives:</hi> Laugh not at me alſo, as they in the Goſpell at Chriſt. All the beſt Authors doe earneſtly contend to have Ebrew eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cape a confuſion at Babel, but ſuffers it to be led captive in the Babylonian captivity. In the grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſt and moſt wonderfull confuſion they keepe it in their braine, but in that ſmaller, their faith de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cayes to hold it? What reaſon or courage is there in that their action or aſſertion? Nothing. I aſſure you if it did live after the confuſion of Babel, (there it muſt either be loſt with all the reſt, or ſpring out with them, or not at all) I warrant you it did live til the time of <hi>Plautus,</hi> about 1800. years ago. If the Punic tongue of <hi>Poenulus</hi> in <hi>Plautus</hi> be the ſame with <hi>Ebrew</hi> or the <hi>Cnaan</hi> tongue, as they them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves confeſſe, and the naturall pedegree doth al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low, they being children of the <hi>Phoenicians,</hi> then their tongue is yet living in <hi>Barbary,</hi> when neither <hi>Greek</hi> nor <hi>Latine</hi> could overcome the natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall tongue of the Land; nor <hi>Arabic,</hi> as <hi>Leo Africa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tus</hi> (in his <hi>deſcription of Africa,</hi> 11. Chapter <hi>of the tongue of Africa</hi>) will have it; he thinking the <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fricans</hi> to have a different tongue from the <hi>Arabic,</hi>
                     <pb n="67" facs="tcp:64385:46"/>wherein he is deceived. Further, from <hi>Plautus</hi> it was there till <hi>Auguſtine,</hi> and the ſame with <hi>Arabic,</hi> as <hi>Geſner, Roccha, Poſtel, Maſius, Bibliander, Schind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ler, Galeottus</hi> and many others doe rightly eſteem, having the <hi>Phoenicians</hi> (their anceſtors) the ſame tongue with <hi>Arabic.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>What an eaſines that gives to any man to learne a tongue, when he can live in that very Country, whoſe tongue he defires to learn, is abudantly known. There is nothing more eaſie and working than that, becauſe that learning is full of life; within a yeare a man may come to a great perfection. Dead tongues get us many rods at Grammar Schoole, becauſe we will revive them. And living tongues can give us no gain, becauſe we doe contemne them. We ſmart at ſchoole for our parents and maſters ſoolery, not for our an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſtors rebellion at Babel. We are chaſtiſed by fooliſh Maſters, becauſe we have fooliſh Fathers. Theſe will have it, and thoſe are willing to doe it. The parents looſe money, the maſters gaine it, but we muſt cry: and why? becauſe a dead tongue will not become living with us. Doe but offer li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving tongues unto children, and ſee how faſt they will learne. There the boyes might whip the old men, becauſe they learne not quick. It is a won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derfull dimneſſe, not only in ſpeciall actions of men, but of Generall ones. Let <hi>England</hi> ſet up Maſters out of <hi>Arabien, Ethiopien, Perſien, Turkey, Armenian, Malayen,</hi> and <hi>Chiney</hi> Countryes, with a whole Col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge for every Nation apart, there to have its na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turall tongue ſpoken and taught in a Grammaticall way (all theſe tongues having but one Generall Grammar, with obſervations of every one of them in particular) and boyes will eaſier learn them than Latine. Nay a man travailing in his young yeares, being well Grammatically inſtructed in his own mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
<pb n="68" facs="tcp:64385:47"/>tongue, will more eaſily, and in a ſhorter time learne all theſe mentioned tongues, and with farre greater delight, than the Latine at Schoole.</p>

                     <hi>Sixthly,</hi> another eaſineſſe ariſes from the near place towards us. For in <hi>Spaine</hi> this holy primitive tongue has been neare 800. yeares, as there is good reaſon it ſhould, having beene alwayes in the poſſeſſion of the <hi>Moores,</hi> (and long before them of the <hi>Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thaginians,</hi>) untill their late expulſion from thence, and yet in the ſteepy mountaines of <hi>Granata,</hi> named <hi>Al Fukhar Râs,</hi> the Progeny of the <hi>Mores</hi> doe ſtill retaine the <hi>Arabic</hi> tongue, for the <hi>Spaniards</hi> them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves call it <hi>Araviga.</hi> There are divers Authors, that ſhew the paſſages of Cities, Provinces, Rivers, and Caſtles in <hi>Spaine,</hi> to be named, inveſted, oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cupied, built and repaired by the <hi>Phoenicians,</hi> and their children the <hi>Carthaginians.

And in <hi>Minſhewes</hi> Dictionary, you may ſee many thouſand Arabic words yet in uſe in <hi>Spaine</hi> at the end of his
<pb n="69" facs="tcp:64385:47"/>book. So neare hath God brought towards us (in the Weſt and North) this Holy and Primitive tongue. Nay within leſſe than ten dayes ſailing you may be in <hi>Africa,</hi> where this tongue is naturall. Tru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly I ſay, if the Engliſh Nation would but once fall diligently upon true Divinity, and not truſt ſo much unto their tranſlations, and (which may be within a yeare for ought I know) perceive that Ebrew is A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rabic, which being yet living and in uſe, is eaſie to be ſearnt, and being obtained, will give a more cleare and true interpretation of the Ebrew Bible (and that with greater eaſe too) than all the Rabbins, I doubt not but they would hereafter change their courſe of ſtudying in dead bookes unto that of living perſons in <hi>Aſia</hi> and <hi>Africa,</hi> (as <hi>Nicolaus Clenardus</hi> did begin, Mr. <hi>Pocoke</hi> and Mr. <hi>Graves</hi> thoſe worthy men have followed, Mr. <hi>Golius,</hi> who had been there, and I my ſelfe had that happineſſe to live there, to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether with Mr. <hi>Pocoke</hi> for ſome months) and thus bring Divinity to a better ground, and fix their in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terpretations upon the Ebrew Mount Zihon. Now whereſoever you will goe, either in <hi>Africa</hi> neare at hand, or in <hi>Aſia</hi> towards <hi>Ioppe, Sidon, Barut,</hi> towards <hi>Cyprus, Alexandria,</hi> or <hi>Alexandretta</hi> the Sea Towne towards <hi>Haleppo,</hi> or to <hi>Smyrna,</hi> or <hi>Conſtantinople</hi> it ſelfe, the paſſage is very eaſie; for I my ſelfe came in a fortnight from <hi>Marſeil</hi> to <hi>Conſtantinople.</hi> The Ship <hi>Sampſon,</hi> (whereof is Captaine Mr. <hi>Swanley,</hi> that worthy and valiant Gentleman, that brought the Ambaſſadours there and here warts,) in going hence to <hi>Smyrna,</hi> perform'd the voyage in 30. dayes, <hi>Anno</hi> 1641. &amp; brought me back again with my Orientall li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brary of above 300 manuſcripts in 17 weeks. Thus you ſee God will ſend us thither more ſpeedily than bring us back againe. Nay, that worthy and reverend friend of mine Mr. <hi>Pocoke</hi> has been twice and a good long
<pb n="70" facs="tcp:64385:48"/>while in that Country, wherby he hath ſo inriched the coffers of his underſtanding with that great and mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fold knowledge of this orientiall tongue, that hee has none but that excellent and thrice learned Mr. <hi>Sel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den,</hi> Eſquire, equall with him. I honour heartily both theſe my worthy friends, and notwithſtanding that I ſhall not be able to amount to the hight of that quickneſſe, largeneſſe, fulneſſe, perfection and acurat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe of learning of theſe two great ſhining lights, the preſent <hi>Sun</hi> and <hi>Moone</hi> of our <hi>England,</hi> it is a great happineſſe for mee, to have that proportion, which the ſtarres of the fixt magnitude have towards them: yet I wiſh, nay hope, that our poſterity may and will outbrave all even the beſt lights.</p>
                  <p>This nearneſſe is an unobſervable occaſion for the Chriſtians to do good to all the <hi>Muhammedans</hi> (or <hi>Mahumedans</hi> as uſually they are called here) <hi>But a ſleeping Cat never ſees a Mouſe running by her clawes. Fronte capillata eſt, poſt eſt occaſio calva;</hi> There is yet a ſmall remnant of the day, to labour by, the night of all the World drawes on, and like a theife in the night, on ſleepers; Wee ſleepe after wee have ſtolen Gods good time of the day, and by the day we ſteale. What will become of us? <hi>Hang him,</hi> is every other word here in <hi>England.</hi> God grant that wee be not the judges of our ſelves and poſterity. Is there never a man, that begins to looke about, and to ſee, what he, wee and all this Kingdome do? we confeſſe out ſinnes, to ſinne the more ſtubborn and conſtantly. Thinke we not once, that all our toyle, running, acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, ſhiſts, prayers, orders and faſts, are but meare hypocriſie? I, becauſe I am a man as well as they, confeſſe, that I have not neede to pry long into my heart, to finde my faults, and hypocriſie; and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by am I ſure they, (that is) every one of whatſoever condition, may ſee his hypocriſie in the performance
<pb n="71" facs="tcp:64385:48"/>of Gods worſhip without great adoe; only in the will lies all our woe; The Spirit, which we call our con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience, doth every day and houre ſpeake within us, (and wo unto him whereunto it ſpeakes no more!) and call us to the Worke of God, (for all this World is but like a dreame full of diſcontents, where even Kings themſelves have the greateſt ſorrowes) to give peace and glory. But becauſe we deſpiſe Gods word and tongue God deſpiſes us.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Seventhly,</hi> the eaſines of this tongue conſiſts likewiſe in the <hi>largenes</hi> of thoſe Countries, wherein it is extant. The greater a Kingdome is (if the King be wiſe and pious, and will let God have a hand in his commands, the eaſier will he withſtand his enemies abroad. The greateſt enemy that the Church of God meets with, is our <hi>ignorance,</hi> whereby wee are afraid to deale with a <hi>Papiſt,</hi> a <hi>Iew,</hi> a <hi>Muhammedan</hi> or a <hi>Heathen</hi> When with a formality of prayer we could do enough in the ſight of our conſciences, then were wee good Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians. But conſcience, conſcience, conſcience that doth gnaw your heart within, and cryes you are but very hypocrits. What <hi>Aſia</hi> will not afford, that <hi>Africa</hi> will, and what <hi>Africa</hi> cannot, <hi>Aſia</hi> can. I con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>felſe there are many different pronunciations, but ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver a Dialect, or Idiome in <hi>Africa</hi> but it will helpe moſt comfortably againſt the darkneſſe and ignorance of this tongue with us. But we are blind, and cannot ſee the cleere Sun-beames. Let there be a hundred divers pronunciations (which common people pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſently call tongues) in <hi>Africa,</hi> yet I know, there is but one tongue. For it is in <hi>Africa</hi> as in <hi>Europe</hi> and <hi>Aſia.</hi> One cryes, a diverſity of tongues, they cannot un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtand one another, another gives them a divers name, the third derives them from a very unknown antiquity, the fourth from the confuſion of <hi>Babell.</hi> My way is contrary. The tongues of <hi>Africa,</hi> are
<pb n="72" facs="tcp:64385:49"/>brought in by <hi>Kham,</hi> his ſons and nephewes and the tongues of <hi>Europe</hi> by <hi>Yafet,</hi> which they fooliſhly cal'd <hi>Jupiter,</hi> and his ſonnes and ſonnes ſonnes. Only in <hi>Europe</hi> is the <hi>Greek</hi> immediately from this Orientall tongue; which <hi>Greek</hi> is the ſame with <hi>Latine.</hi> If no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing elſe could perſwade you; 10000 <hi>Latine</hi> words at leaſt, already derived by divers Authours from thence will ſuffice to do. Now from this <hi>Latine</hi> ſome affirme <hi>Italian, Spaniſh,</hi> and <hi>French</hi> to deſcend, others deny it. If you looke upon two narrow a time and ſpace of that tougue, <hi>(viz. Latine)</hi> as onely in that part of <hi>Italy,</hi> where <hi>Rome</hi> is ſeated, called now <hi>Lo ſtato Eccleſiaſtico,</hi> and at the time of the Counſuls of <hi>Rome,</hi> than you muſt not bring all theſe tongues from thence, becauſe all theſe Countries had tongues be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the ſaid time, but if you can rationally judge, that tongues breed not out of the earth, nor raigne down from Heaven, and are propagated onely by man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kinde amongſt themſelves; than reflecting back; that all theſe men came from <hi>Yafet,</hi> all theſe I ſay in <hi>Ger<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>many, Italy France Spaine, Poland, &amp;c.</hi> their tongues are without all doubt derived from thence. So that, as <hi>Italy</hi> had a tongue at <hi>Aeneas</hi> comming thither from <hi>Troja,</hi> and they were deſcending from the <hi>Gre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cians,</hi> and the <hi>Grecians</hi> out of <hi>Aſia</hi> (whereof <hi>Troja</hi> is a Towne) then brought <hi>Aeneas</hi> the ſame tongue with him out of that ſame Fountaine, from whence <hi>Evander</hi> and all the <hi>Grecians</hi> before had fetcht theirs. So before <hi>Aeneas</hi> came, people lived already in <hi>France, Spaine, Germany,</hi> they were children of the <hi>Graecians,</hi> had their tongue, which grew different in <hi>Italy,</hi> ſo much more in <hi>France, Germany, Spaine,</hi> and <hi>Poland,</hi> &amp;c. And ſo farre you may deny them to deſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cend from the <hi>Latine.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>There is alſo further eaſineſſe, <hi>viz.</hi> by way of teach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing. Firſt, to teach the whole <hi>Ebrew</hi> Bible (every part
<pb n="73" facs="tcp:64385:49"/>and Word thereof affording ſome good ground for Exhortation, Doctrine and Learning) ſo that I can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not commend the ordinary way of teaching onely one booke of it (notwithſtanding it hath beene the conſtant practice hitherto, ſome teaching <hi>Geneſis,</hi> others the <hi>Pſalmes,</hi> or the bookes of <hi>Samuel, Hoſeas,</hi> or ſome of the <hi>major</hi> or <hi>minor</hi> Prophets, (and this under pretence that theſe bookes containe in them a great part of the <hi>Ebrew</hi> Bible) never going through it all.) For by that meanes the learner is left to ſhift for himſelfe before hee be able, whereby hee con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceaves a greater difficulty to bee in it then indeed there is, and ſo gives it over; not onely himſelfe but likewiſe (either by example or perſwaſion) deterrs o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers from undertaking it.</p>
                  <p>I would likewiſe have you to teach the <hi>Caldean, Targum</hi> of the three Authors, <hi>Ionathan, Onkelos,</hi> and <hi>Ioſeph</hi> the blinde: together with the <hi>Syriac</hi> and <hi>Arabic</hi> (publiſhed at <hi>Rome,</hi>) but hence it may be ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jected that the <hi>Galdean Targum</hi> is not extant by it ſelfe but onely in thoſe bibles in folio publiſhed by the <hi>Venetians, Buxtorph,</hi> both the Kings of <hi>Spaine</hi> and <hi>France;</hi> To this I anſwer that it is true, but if this courſe were taken that I preſcribe, and that there were profeſſors (eſtabliſhed by authority) that would teach them in <hi>Engliſh,</hi> (and that every day through<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out the yeare) I doubt not but that the Citizens would moſt gladly bee auditors and buy the books, which the Booke ſellers would moſt willingly get printed ſo ſoone as they ſhall perceive a certaine gain to come in by the plentifull vending of them.</p>
                  <p>Farther I wiſh my Orientall Profeſſor vvould <hi>firſt,</hi> teach my Generall Grammer with the eſſentiall part of it, <hi>viz.</hi> conſonants in Orthography, and Analogy or Etymology: <hi>ſecondly,</hi> teach the whole <hi>Ebrew</hi> bible vvithout points exerciſing his Schollers to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pend
<pb n="74" facs="tcp:64385:50"/>onely upon the conſonants, they giving the full ſence) and upon all occaſions to tell them that the pronunciation is not materiall to the words or ſence, and that all tongues differ (amongſt themſelves) in point of pronunciation, ſtill increaſing by every mile (though not obſerved) even as the Sun proceeding every moment upon the diall is not perceived till it hath paſt ſome certaine time, ſo here the difference of the pronunciation will not ſo well be obſerved in few miles as in 50, or 100, or more. Yet if the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſor do meete with ſuch as will have the vowells and accents (which indeed is but a burthen without profit unto them) I advize him to ingraft into their mindes that Orthographicall ground worke which the <hi>Iewes</hi> did eſteeme needfull to have, <hi>viz.</hi> in <hi>Ebrew</hi> and <hi>Calde</hi> 15 Vowels (when five (as by the <hi>Syrians</hi>) would have ſerved) but in Analogy or Etymology to ſhew diligently their <hi>mutation,</hi> long into ſhort, and ſhort into long, <hi>permutation,</hi> long for ſhort, and ſhort for long: and <hi>contraction</hi> or <hi>abjection</hi> of any of them long or ſhort. And becauſe hee cannot ſhew that perfectly before he have ſet downe what Vowells there were in this or that place (all the Grammarians having left that out) he may take a delineation there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of from my <hi>Latine</hi> delineation, <hi>page</hi> 73. 74. <hi>tit. Anal. Specialis.</hi>

                  <p>And likewiſe I adviſe him to go a different way from that commonly uſed for <hi>Ebrew</hi> (with ſuch diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples) becauſe they will expect a Grammaticall Analiſis of the words.) <hi>viz.</hi> take <hi>Buxtorfs Ebrew</hi> Dictionary Printed here at <hi>London,</hi> and reſolve all his examples by theſe Grammer precepts that I have given and thereby hee will doe his Schollers more profit then with the greateſt booke in the bible, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe in none of them doe occurre all the Radixes, extant in the Dixionary; for there is obſerved not
<pb n="75" facs="tcp:64385:50"/>onely the Alphabeticall order of the rootes, but alſo that moſt neceſſary Grammaticall order of the Ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes, perſons, and orders, (though not in the ſame order that is in my Grammer) the order herein do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing neither good nor hurt. Or if yet a ſhorter way muſt be had, then take <hi>Toſſanus</hi> little Dictionary up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the <hi>Pſalmes</hi> and do therewith as before; and for the <hi>Calde</hi> take <hi>Buxtorfs</hi> Concordance where at the end hee hath ſet downe all the <hi>Calde</hi> words occur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent in the bible. Where you will finde the eſſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiall parts, <hi>viz.</hi> of Conſonantes to be according to Grammaticall precepts, and for the Vowells you will finde the diſtinctions of long and ſhort to be forgot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten by thoſe late <hi>Iewiſh</hi> punctators. For the <hi>Syriac</hi> go the ſame way in <hi>Crineſius</hi> or <hi>Troſtius</hi> Dictionaries upon the New Teſtament In <hi>Arabic</hi> the Grammaticall Analiticall way is farre more eaſy: and as yet there is not any Dictionary extant thereof either upon the Bible or <hi>Alcoran,</hi> but upon the latter I expect one ſpeedily.</p>
                  <p>This fundament being once well layed (which will make the following worke eaſy) let the Schollers <hi>firſt</hi> read, and give the interpretation of, 1, 2, 4, 6, 8, 10, or more Chapters every day, beginning with <hi>Ebrew,</hi> and then with <hi>Calde, Samaritic,</hi> and ſo on untill they have gon through the Bible therein, 3 or 4 times, if poſſible, in a year. <hi>Secondly,</hi> let them make ſome ſmall exerciſes (as ſome little ſtory, ſentence, fable, or at the higheſt an Epiſtle) in every diſtinct dia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lect of this tongue. <hi>Thirdly,</hi> let them make <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap>, (as <hi>Aphthonius</hi> cals them, in his <hi>Progymnaſmes</hi>) Ora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, or Diſcourſes in the Tongue. <hi>Fourthly,</hi> let them take ſome <hi>Rabbins</hi> workes, and bring them in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to Artes and Sciences by way of common place re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferring unto the number of the leafe, <hi>Columnes,</hi> and line. This worke will be very uſefull hereafter not
<pb n="76" facs="tcp:64385:51"/>onely for themſelves but alſo for the publike; for thereby Chriſtians may the better ſhew the <hi>Iewes</hi> their errours in Arts as well as tenents in Divinity, and ſo bring them to Chriſt. <hi>Fifthly,</hi> the ſame thing may be done on the <hi>Talmud</hi> which the next year will come out at <hi>Amſterdam</hi> in 4<hi rend="sup">o</hi> to be bound up in 6, or 8 volums.</p>
                  <p>It is further to be made eaſy by a good way of learn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing which here is written in reſpect of the moſt who cannot here the Profeſſor, or have a Maſter at all, unto thoſe I will give this councell; That yea would reſolve never to give over the ſtudy of it untill you have obtained it perfectly, and you may doe it if you will follow this way. <hi>Firſt,</hi> (if you underſtand <hi>Latin</hi>) take <hi>Arias Montanus Ebrew</hi> bible with the interlineary <hi>Latin</hi> verſion, good for two reaſons 1. be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe the order of the <hi>Ebrew</hi> words are now and then differing from the <hi>Engliſh,</hi> and common <hi>Latin</hi> tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſlation, 2. becauſe the roote is written in the margent whereby you will be preſently inabled to uſe any <hi>Ebrew</hi> Dictionary. If you underſtand not <hi>Latine</hi> then take an <hi>Ebrew,</hi> and an <hi>Engliſh</hi> bible (without ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pecting any <hi>Engliſh</hi> Dictionary, for it will ſerve in ſtead thereof) obſerving the tranſpoſitions of words which will not be difficult becauſe not frequent. Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gin with the firſt Chapter of <hi>Geneſis</hi> (never with the <hi>Pſalmes</hi> for they being written in a poeticall ſtrayne are to hard for a young Scholler) thus. <hi>The firſt verſe hath ſeven words:</hi> Bresît <hi>in the beginning: here</hi> B. <hi>ſignifies in:</hi> resît: <hi>a,</hi> or <hi>the beginning,</hi> it is a Noune bara <hi>created,</hi> it is a Verbe: (here you ſee a tranſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſition) <hi>Elohim: God,</hi> a Nowne: êt: <hi>the,</hi> a Noune: (which (as is frequent even in the <hi>Engliſh</hi> tongue) was left out in the firſt word <hi>resît</hi>) haſſamayim <hi>Heaven</hi> a noun: vêt: <hi>and the,</hi> a noun, with u; <hi>and,</hi> haaretz <hi>the earth,</hi> a noun where <hi>e</hi> or <hi>h</hi> notes <hi>the,</hi> in this verſe beſides ſix
<pb n="77" facs="tcp:64385:51"/>full words, <hi>viz.</hi> five Nounes and one Verbe, you have three little words, <hi>viz.</hi> b: <hi>in,</hi> e, or h: <hi>the,</hi> v, <hi>and,</hi> theſe three and thoſe ſix, (together nine) vvords, vvill pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſently carry you a great way in the Chapter; and ſo continue till you come thorough the whole bible; Regard not the Vowells ſo much as Conſonants, for if you finde <hi>aretz</hi> or <hi>eretz, Lamek</hi> or <hi>Lemek, Habel,</hi> or <hi>Hebel</hi> it is not materiall. And to that purpoſe (if you finde your ſelfe ſtrong enough) buy the bible without points for by that meanes you will have gay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned halfe the vvorke vvhich otherwiſe you muſt have vvith Vowells and Accents. You need not care vvhi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther you pronounce it right or vvrong, for at this very day the <hi>Iewes</hi> differ among themſelves therein, and why then ſhouldeſt thou binde thy ſelfe vvhen thou mayſt be free? Regard not the Accents at all, for they are but ſuperfluous fancies. When thou haſt gone through the firſt Chapter in the <hi>Ebrew</hi> Dialect, do it in <hi>Calde, Syriac,</hi> &amp;c: therein taking notice that the different words are Synonyma's, for example <hi>bqad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>min</hi> is ſynon. to <hi>bresît. bra</hi> and <hi>bara,</hi> is the ſame. <hi>Thovah</hi> to <hi>Elohim, yat</hi> and <hi>êt</hi> the ſame, (as by this rule: <hi>The quieſcent Letters,</hi> viz. <hi>a, v, y, e</hi> or <hi>h. doe frequently change without altering the ſignification.</hi>) <hi>Smayya</hi> the ſame <hi>with Smayim, arha</hi> the ſame vvith <hi>aretz</hi> (it may be that <hi>ayin</hi> is conſtantly in <hi>Calde</hi> miſtaken for <hi>izade,</hi> or elſe changed thereinto. The <hi>Samaritan</hi> is the ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry ſame <hi>verbatim</hi> vvith the <hi>Ebrew</hi> throughout the pentateuch, but onely in ſome places where thoſe <hi>Iewes</hi> vvhich vvere called <hi>Samaritans</hi> (in <hi>Luke</hi> 10: 33.17: 16. <hi>Iohn</hi> 4: 9.48. and divers other places) did differ from the common reading of the Law. In this way you may exerciſe your ſelfe in the eſſentiall part of the Grammer, <hi>viz.</hi> Conſonants, leaving the Vow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ells and Accents: which notwithſtanding I have ſet downe in my Grammer, and (as yee may obſerve
<pb n="78" facs="tcp:64385:52"/>takes up the greateſt part thereof, for <hi>ad ſuper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flua ſudatur,</hi> ſayes <hi>Seneca</hi>) becauſe every body will not bee content without them, though many Schollers have left this ſtudy by reaſonof theſe ſuper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fluities.</p>
                  <p>Now thus farre I have ſpoken my minde concer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning this. One orientall primitive tongue, (com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehended under the name of ſix tongues <hi>viz Ebrew, Calde, Samaritan, Syriac, Arahic,</hi> and <hi>Ethiopic</hi>) the mother tongue of the whole World: onely I deſire to leave with the courteous Reader ſome generall no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions about the tongues. Firſt, <hi>A torgue may be gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall and yet not vulgar.</hi> Which not being obſerved, makes the common people believe that this or that, is the Mother tongue, here or there, as for inſtance; The <hi>Greeke</hi> tongue was ſpoken (as is recorded by <hi>Strabo</hi> in his 14 booke) by the <hi>Galatians, Carians</hi> (a people of 16 ſeverall Nations) <hi>Cataonians, Cappado<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cians, Galatians, Maeonians,</hi> and <hi>Sydians.</hi> All Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinces of the ſaid <hi>Carians.</hi> Yet <hi>Hierome</hi> and <hi>Euphorus</hi> affirme, that <hi>Greeke</hi> was not the vulgar or native lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guage of theſe parts, but they had their peculiar and naturall tongues, ſo that of theſe 21 Nations of the <hi>Carians</hi> there were onely three <hi>Graecians,</hi> all the reſt uſed there owne native orientall tongue which (be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe different from theirs) the proud <hi>Grecians</hi> cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led <hi>Barbarous.</hi> This being well obſerved will cleare up many doubts about particular tongues. Secondly, <hi>Wee muſt looke at the writings and not pronunciations of a people.</hi> So that although never ſo many Authors affirme that this or that tongue are different from each other, and ground it onely upon the pronun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciation, they will not bee able to make good their poſition: for even here in <hi>England</hi> (as alſo in other Countries) there are not any two ſhiers that pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounce the Language in every reſpect alike, and yet
<pb n="79" facs="tcp:64385:52"/>no man attributes to every ſhire a ſeverall language. Thirdly, <hi>Wee muſt looke to the radicall writing of a word:</hi> this hath beene excellently well practiſed in the Orientall primitive tongue, but never yet or ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry ſlowly in the derivatives. Which if once per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed would doubtleſly make us able to judge of tongues more rationally in generall, to give the eti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mology of a word more exactly. Fourthly, <hi>The di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſity of Cbaracters make not a different tongue.</hi> For even in one and the ſame tongue every man writes ſeverally, and as it pleaſeth himſelfe, <hi>viz.</hi> One man formeth them thus, and another 10. Fifthly, <hi>The unity of the Characters make not divers tongues become one.</hi> As wee ſee in <hi>Latine, Italian, Spaniſh, French, Poland, Hungary, Iriſh, Engliſh,</hi> and the <hi>Hurones</hi> with other people in the Weſt-Indies who ſince the comming in of the <hi>Engliſh, Spaniards</hi> and <hi>French</hi> have learnt the <hi>Latine</hi> Alphabet, and it may be in time all the Weſt Indies will get and make uſe of the ſame Character. Yet it cannot bee thought that ſo great a part of the new World (lying oppoſite to our three knowne parts of the old, <hi>Aſia, Africa,</hi> and <hi>Eurepe,</hi>) ſhould not have many different tongues. Sixtly; <hi>All tongues will participate in ſome things with their Neighbours,</hi> for as it is in other actions ſo it is with man who being <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap>, aſociable and tractable perſon is ſenſible of his owne want and others abundance in divers things: whereby we are conſirained to borrow and lend one of another. This being ſo common and ſo neceſſary in any ſociety of men, is performed be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore wee take notice of it, and becauſe it is naturally inſcribed in us wee do it conſtantly and willingly making no ſcruple at it. And ſeeing nothing coſts us leſſe then the lending of words, and more needfull (to deale with ſtrangers) then borrowing, that makes a dayly trade between tongues and tongues in all the
<pb n="80" facs="tcp:64385:53"/>World. Seventhly, <hi>Authors, names, and tongues, will afford good ground for the unity or diverſity of them.</hi> As for inſtance when <hi>Geſnerus</hi> (that learned, and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traordinary painfull man in <hi>Switzerland</hi>) <hi>Angelus Rocca. Poſtellus, Maſius, Bibliander, Schindler, Mart. Galeotus.</hi> And divers other learned men do affirm, that the ancient <hi>Punic</hi> tongue (ſpoken in <hi>Africa</hi> about the time of <hi>Plautus</hi> and <hi>Auguſtine</hi>) was <hi>Arabic, viz.</hi> that tongue which is at this day vulgar in <hi>Africa;</hi> And that many words thereof extant in ſeverall Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thors (as that in <hi>Plautus</hi> his <hi>Poeiulus</hi>) will appeare to be of the ſame eſſence with <hi>Arabic,</hi> who will here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>after argue that theſe learned men were poſſeſſed with a phantaſy as it hath beene heretofore done, or that the name <hi>Phoeaicians,</hi> and <hi>Punics</hi> are not juditi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſly argued to bee the ſame people for deſcent, like father and children, and therefore one and the ſame tongue, yet in way of weight I will place theſe three contrary and conclude, <hi>that the Tongue, the name, and the Authors together: do yeald a good ground to judge of the unity or diverſity thereof.</hi> Eighthly, <hi>The ſituation of a Country conduceth much to the right judgement of a tongue.</hi> As for inſtance the <hi>Perſic</hi> tongue is very hardly believed to bee of kindred with the <hi>Ger<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man</hi> notwithſtanding that many words are the very ſame, or almoſt the ſame with one another. Ninthly, <hi>A Tongue cannot ſuddainly bee made native.</hi> For that which is already in uſe and every day practi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed will not eaſily give way unto a new one eſpecially if it be different in eſſence. Tenthly, <hi>A Tongue ſud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dainly ariſing is the native Tongue.</hi> When a people are quiet and not active either in Warre, merchan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dize or ſhipping (eſpecially if farre diſtant) men will not regard their tongue, but let them bee active and ſhew themſelves abroade, and then they will be preſently taken notice of, when therefore the <hi>Arabic</hi>
                     <pb n="81" facs="tcp:64385:53"/>tongue (as authors weakly affirme) had over-runne ſo vaſt a ſpace of above 3000 Engliſh miles in length, from its Eaſt the Perſian Gulfe untill the laſt place of Affrica Weſt hitherwards, and that with eaſe, and without the groaning or murmuring of the people, as lying under the burthen of a new tongue: is not this ſufficient to convince us (Europeans) who are ignorant in our homebred tongues) that without doubt this hath been the naturall and na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive tongue.</p>
                  <p>Eleventhly. <hi>The derived tongues in Europe make up only one body of a tongue, alwayes varying, but never wholly decaying.</hi> As the Originall and Primitive (op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſite to the derivative) is yet remaining, ſo are alſo the derivatives, and not yet loſt. For as long as the Analogy of <hi>Adam</hi> remaines in men, ſo long will the Analogy of the derived tongues remaine in E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brew, the accidentalls whereof being many in one age, are but one in many ages: And I wiſh that hereafter it might be conſidered how much nature workes in this behalfe.</p>
                  <p>Twelfthly. <hi>No Country populated is void of a tongue.</hi> For where there are men, there muſt be a tongue, and hence that proverb is true, <hi>Non datur vacuum in rerum natura, there is nothing void in nature.</hi> Wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore it is unfound to ſay that this or that Country having before no tongue, hath in time gotten this or that.</p>
                  <p>Thirteenthly. <hi>Wee muſt not rely only upon Hiſtory.</hi> This I confeſſe, belongs unto the name Authority, ſo that it ſhould not have made a new propofition. But becauſe every one looks not upon Hiſtory as an ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gument from Authority, (eſpecially the Author being behind the curtaines) and I proſeſſe not to write here exactly logically, but only by way of Eſſay. I thought good to ſet this apart from that of Authori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty,
<pb n="82" facs="tcp:64385:54"/>others having done it before me. Neither this nor that muſt be looked upon ſo farre as to dote up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on either of them, eſpecially when other men have better grounds (in reaſon) from the very tongue it ſelfe. As for inſtance, if Hiſtorians aſſirme it ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver ſo confidently that the <hi>Punics</hi> were of a diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent off ſpring from the <hi>Arabians,</hi> and that it is onely a thouſand yeares ſince that tongue was by the Arabians brought into Africa. Yet becauſe wee know that the Arabians, and thoſe from whence the Punics did deſcend (<hi>viz.</hi> the <hi>Phoenicians</hi>) were of one tongue, we know that it is an unſound aſſerti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on to ſay that the ancient Punic tongue is not the ſame with Arabic ſpoken at this day in Affrica.</p>
                  <p>Fourteenthly, <hi>The Primitive tongue never alters its nature.</hi> This propoſition is not much thought on by Authors, when they conceive that the Orientall tongue doth ſometimes change from pure, to impure, from learned, to unlearned and vulgar, ſometimes increaſing, and then again decreaſing: But this can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be ſo becauſe of its primitiveneſſe, whereby it is ſimple, and will not ſuffer ſuch gradations and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clenſions: For by their ſingleneſſe they are more ſtrictly bound unto the conſonants, and leſſe unto the vowels, their changings and caſtings, than the un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>skilfull of them can conceive.</p>
                  <p>Fifteenthly, <hi>All derived tongues are changeable.</hi> So that if the Occidentall, Meridiall, or Septentri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>onall tongues would conſider this, they would not claime ſuch a prerogative above the primitive. A derived tongue will vary in the generality, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived pureneſſe and elegancie, and cannot remaine conſtant. Becauſe, Firſt it is derived. And ſecondly, it hath a vaſt variety of pronunciation expreſſed in all their writings, both in vowels and conſonants.</p>
                  <p>Sixteenthly, <hi>A ſtrange tongue howſoever it may en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dure
<pb n="83" facs="tcp:64385:54"/>for a time, it cannot continue for ever.</hi> We have an example hereof in the Greek tongue, which ſpread very farre, eſpecially towards the Eaſt, <hi>viz.</hi> in <hi>Syria, Paleſtina, Cilicia,</hi> part of <hi>Meſopotamia,</hi> and <hi>Arabia</hi> as is affirmed by <hi>Hierome:</hi> the dialect there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of being taken from <hi>Tyrus</hi> (for <hi>Syr, Sur, Dyr, Dur, Dor</hi>) was called <hi>Doric.</hi> But yet at the inundations of the Turkes or Sarazens it came to ruine; having been a ſtranger there for about 7 or 800. yeares.</p>
                  <p>Seventeenthly, <hi>A tongue that riſes in a country, and caſts out a knowne ſtrange to gue, is the true native tongue though formerly unknowne. Hierome</hi> in the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>em upon the ſecond booke of his comment upon the <hi>Galatians</hi> ſayes, that part of Arabia (which muſt needs have had the Arabic tongue) ſpake Greek: hence it followes that Arabic was the vulgar ſpeech thereof, as Syriac of Syria.</p>
                  <p>Eighteenthly, <hi>Diverſitie of a climate, mingling with ſtrangers, and tract of time, may doe much to change a tongue.</hi> It is not the confuſion of Babell, and the puniſhment of the Sinar rebels that is hereditary unto us (in the multiplicity of ſpeech) as <hi>Adams</hi> corruptions are, but thoſe three things I ſet downe in the propoſition. For had there never been a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſion at Babel, this multiplicity of tongues would have been. The Scripture, Calde paraphraſts, Sibyls and all ſpeake of one tongue, not many. No man will deny that there is a multitude now, but whither from Babel or not is the queſtion, which I determine negatively, <hi>It is,</hi> but <hi>not from Babel.</hi> Nor is <hi>Augu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtines</hi> reaſon right, <hi>pro peccato diſſenſionis humanae, for the ſin of man diſagreeing, not only different diſpoſiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, but different tongues came into the world.</hi> For <hi>Cayin</hi> and <hi>Habel,</hi> (or <hi>Hebel</hi>) diſagreed, (but there was no ſuch puniſhment) and ſo by degrees this diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>agreement grew hotter and hotter, inſomuch that in
<pb n="84" facs="tcp:64385:55"/>1656. yeares there grew ſuch a fierce fire, that all the water in the world (much leſſe a confuſion of their tongues) but the whole cataracts from heaven muſt breake out to quench it. Nay there was rather a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary nature in thoſe at Babel, for before the deluge they could not agree, but after it they conſpired to bee together in one place. <hi>Cum quiſque principatum rapit, when every one would govern,</hi> (as <hi>Auſtin</hi> thinks) was rather before the deluge then after it, for it is without warrant of Scripture, for there it is not ſaid that every one did ſtrive at Babel for dominion. Nor was it (as <hi>Abidenus</hi> did conceive) to make them a way unto heaven, a childiſh conceit. Nor for feare of another (perhaps) enſuing deluge, as <hi>Joſephus L.</hi> 1. <hi>de Ant. Iud. ca.</hi> 2. thinkes. Nor for feare of the conſumption of the world by fire. Nor upon that falſe reaſon of their certaine agreement for Idolatry, (which the Jeruſalem tranſlation holds forth) by the phraſe of <hi>preparing an everlaſting name,</hi> a phraſe too common in all languages to be here underſtood for that fearfull name of <hi>God Almighty,</hi> as is to be ſeen in the 2 <hi>Sam.</hi> 18: 13. <hi>Eſ.</hi> 63: 12. &amp; 14. <hi>Jer.</hi> 32: 20. <hi>Dan.</hi> 9: 15. Nor becauſe they feared a confuſion or diſperſion to come; but becauſe they would live al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>together in one Kingdome, and ſet up at <hi>Sinear</hi> the Reſidence for their King, and get for themſelves an everlaſting name, which being againſt the coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſell of God, (who would have them to fill the earth here and there) he did diſperſe them with that tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>porary variety of pronunciations whereby they were not able to underſtand one another, though the tongue remained one and the ſame, no new tongues then coyned, no new languages then on a ſuddaine ariſing, the variety of their pronunciation being a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bundantly ſufficient to diſperſe them, which was the intention of God. One tongue being before the
<pb n="85" facs="tcp:64385:55"/>confuſion of Babel, one in it, and one after it. For the Ebrew word <gap reason="foreign">

Yet theſe two or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gans in our mouth are contradiſtinct, for the tongue is not the lip, nor the lip the tongue, and the tongue letters are different from the lip letters (as all Ebrew Grammarians ſhew) and ſo they are alſo oppoſed <hi>Pſal.</hi> 12.4. <hi>Who have ſaid, with our tongue will we prevaile, our lips are our owne, who is Lord over us?</hi> and <hi>Pſ.</hi> 140: 3. 1 <hi>Corin.</hi> 14: 21. We have but one tongue, though two lips: one tongue, but divers pronunciations. And the ſcripture tels us that God did not confound the tongue (leſſe tongues) but the lips, the inſtrument forming the pronunciation, not of coyning words. <hi>Abydenus</hi> by <hi>Euſebius</hi> and <hi>Cyrillus,</hi> expreſſely oppoſe theſe things alſo. <gap reason="foreign">

                  <p>Nay theſe three reaſons have beene briefly touched by that worthy and learned author <hi>Edward Brerewood,</hi> in his enquiries touching the diverſities of languages in two places firſt page 51. <hi>The Pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nic tongue ſeemeth to me out of queſtion to have bin the Cnaanitiſh or old Ebrew language, though (I doubt not) ſomewhat altered from the Originall pronuncia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, as is wont</hi> (1) <hi>in tract of time to befall</hi> (2) <hi>Colonyes planted</hi> (3) <hi>among ſtrangers farre from home.</hi> Againe pag. 57. <hi>And certainly touching the difference that was betweene the Ebrew and the Punic, I make no doubt but</hi> (1) <hi>their great diſtance from their primitive habitation, and</hi> (2) <hi>their converſation with ſtrangers among whom they were planted, and</hi> (3) <hi>to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether with both the length of time which is wont to bring alteration to all the languages in the world, were the cauſes of it.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Nineteenthly, <hi>The Ebrews and Ebrew tongue are not denominated from Eber.</hi> The text <hi>Gen.</hi> 10:21. tranſlated runnes thus. <hi>Concerning Sem (born to be the Grandfather of all the progeny beyond the River, brother of</hi> Yaſet <hi>the Elder</hi>) 22. <hi>The ſons of</hi> Sem <hi>were</hi> Elam, <hi>and</hi> Aſſur, <hi>and</hi> Arfacſad, <hi>and</hi> Lud, <hi>and</hi> Aram. 23. <hi>But the ſonnes of</hi> Aram, Uz, <hi>and</hi> Khus, <hi>and</hi> Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, <hi>and</hi> Mas. 24. <hi>But</hi> Arfacſad <hi>begat</hi> Salakh, <hi>and</hi> Selakh <hi>begat that</hi> Eber. 25. <hi>But to</hi> Eber <hi>was borne a twinling of ſonnes: the name of the firſt was</hi> Feleg, [diviſion] <hi>becauſe in his dayes</hi> [niflega] <hi>there was divided the whole earth, but the name of his brother was</hi> Joqthan [the little one]</p>
                  <p>Upon this place have the Jewes conſtantly built the title of their name and tongue, but in my weak judgment, without reaſon. Nay <hi>Abraham</hi> in <hi>Gen.</hi> 14: 13. is alſo called <gap reason="foreign">

                     <hi>Haibrai, the ſtranger from beyond the River</hi> [Frat] which is unreaſonably tranſlated, <hi>the Ebrew,</hi> as if hee alſo tooke his name
<pb n="87" facs="tcp:64385:56"/>from <hi>Eber.</hi> The reaſons given for this opinion are theſe. Firſt, if the word came of <hi>Aber,</hi> rather than <hi>Eber,</hi> the word ſhould have been <hi>haabri,</hi> not <hi>haibri.</hi> I anſwer, 'tis true, but there is no ſuch word as <hi>Aber a paſſe,</hi> but <hi>Eber,</hi> that proper name it ſelfe denotes <hi>a paſſe.</hi> Secondly, <hi>Eugubinus</hi> ſayes, becauſe they ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minate the names of nations and kindreds (deſcend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing from proper names) in <hi>Yod,</hi> as <hi>Yhudy</hi> from <hi>Yhu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dah</hi> a Jew, <hi>Amalqy</hi> from <hi>Amaleq</hi> an Amalekite. Therefore this name <hi>haibri</hi> is moſt like to be derived from the proper name <hi>Eber,</hi> and to ſignifie <hi>the Ebrew.</hi> I anſwer, in the very ſame chapter, <hi>viz. Gen.</hi> 10. there are 21 names of Nations, <hi>viz.</hi> in the 4. <hi>v. Kittim, Dodanim.</hi> 6. <hi>Mizrayim.</hi> 13. <hi>Ludim, Anamim, Lha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bim, Naftukhim.</hi> 14. <hi>Fatruſhim, Keſhlukhim, Fli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtim, Caftorim.</hi> 16. <hi>Ybuſi, Emori, Girgjaſi, Khivvi, Arqi, Shini, Arvadi, Zmari, Khamati, Cnaani.</hi> Are all theſe derived from proper names, and none from appellatives? Thirdly, that <hi>Abraham</hi> was called <hi>an Ebrew</hi> of <hi>Eber,</hi> becauſe all thoſe, and none but thoſe that continued in his faith retayned the name. I anſwer, that we have not any place in Scripture which commends <hi>Eber</hi> for his faith. And therefore <hi>Abram</hi> may not receive this name upon an uncertain conjecture, when we have an infallible reaſon why called <hi>haibri,</hi> and that is this. That <hi>Abraham</hi> being in <hi>Meſopotamia</hi> or <hi>Aram Naharayim,</hi> (which place he and his ſervant in <hi>Gen.</hi> 24: 4.5.7. &amp; 10. <hi>v.</hi> called his Country, becauſe hee had dwelt there with his then dead father, and yet living brother <hi>Nakhor</hi>) was cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led away from Kharan, from his brother <hi>Nakhor,</hi> out of the houſe of his father to goe into <hi>Cnaan,</hi> where he was a ſtranger,; and ſo all along in <hi>Cnaan, Egypt,</hi> and <hi>Elon Mamreh</hi> he was called from being a ſtranger, a paſſenger: the Cnaanites not regarding or happily knowing any thing of <hi>Eber.</hi> To be ſhort, <hi>Abraham</hi> was
<pb n="88" facs="tcp:64385:57"/>not eſteemed or called by thoſe Heatheniſh <hi>Cnaanites</hi> an <hi>Ebrew</hi> with reſpect to <hi>Eber</hi> (of whom perhaps they knew nothing) but from his being a ſtranger, a forrainer, a paſſenger, a Highlander, a Sojurner, a be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yond-ſea-man, whom the <hi>Arabians</hi> call Ma-wara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nahny, and in <hi>Latine</hi> wee finde <hi>Tranſylvanus, Tranſ-Iſulanus,</hi> and by the <hi>Italians Tra-montano.</hi> The rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon is rationally drawne. Firſt, from the common faſhion of all people to call a ſtranger and forraigner, not from his father (who uſually they know not) much leſſe from his ſeventh Grand-father, and yet leaſt from an unknowne man who was borne 270 years before. Secondly, from the holy Ghoſt out of the mouth of a dying Martyr, Acts 7.6. <hi>And God ſpake on this wiſe, that his ſeede ſhould ſojourne in a ſtrange Land.</hi> His ſeed ſhould bee called a ſojurner why? Becauſe in a ſtrange Land, Thirdly, none were called <hi>Ebrews</hi> from <hi>Eber</hi> before <hi>Abraham.</hi> Fourthly, <hi>Abraham</hi> himſelfe was not called ſo before hee came over the River in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to <hi>Cnaan,</hi> and although hee be not called a ſtranger in all the 12 and 13, and untill the 13 Verſe of the 14 Chapter, it muſt not ſeeme ſtrange, becauſe of his moſt valiant and ſtrange victory over foure Kings, (under one whereof he was likely borne) and relieve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing five Kings of his dwelling Country. <hi>Moſes</hi> ſets downe firſt that contemptible name, which hee had before and now <gap reason="foreign">

But to make it more cleare whither the Nation of the <hi>Iewes</hi> could be called <hi>Ebrews</hi> from <hi>Eber</hi> or no, I will give you all thoſe places where that name is uſed in the Old Teſtament, but before I doe that I would deſire you to conſider what <hi>Ioſephs</hi> Miſtris knew of the 10<hi rend="sup">th</hi> Grand-father of her ſervant. Whom ſhe loved (not becauſe diſcending from <hi>Eber,</hi> nor becauſe a ſtranger,) but becauſe beaucifull, that grace in him did ſuppreſſe all that contempt uſually following a ſtran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger;
<pb n="89" facs="tcp:64385:57"/>nor did ſhee aggrevate her accuſation againſt him to her Husband as being of the race of <hi>Eber</hi> (of whom I dare ſay they knew nothing) but becauſe a ſervant, and a ſtranger. The places I give you here at large, <hi>Geneſis</hi> 14: 13. 39: 14.17. 40: 15. 41: 12. 43: 32. <hi>Exodus</hi> 1:15, 16, 19. 2: 6, 7, 11 13. 3: 18. 5: 3. 7: 16. 9: 1.13. 21: 2. <hi>Deut.</hi> 15: 12.1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 4: 6.9. 13: 3.7.19. 14: 11. 21. 29: 3. <hi>Ier.</hi> 34: 9.14. <hi>Iona.</hi> 1:9.

So that wee ſee the folly of the new <hi>Iewes,</hi> and our old Chriſtian <hi>Ebrew</hi> profeſſors in believing that the <hi>Iewes</hi> ſpeak Oracles. Twentith, <hi>Ebrew, Calde, Samaritic, Syriac, Arabic</hi> and <hi>Ethiopic, are of one and the ſame antiquity.</hi> This propoſition takes away ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny ſuperfluous queſtions, and unreaſonable anſwers of many Authors that have hither to handled this ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject. For if <hi>Ebrew</hi> were chiefe in <hi>Cnaan,</hi> then I am ſure <hi>Arabic</hi> would be the elder, becauſe firſt inhabited as lying neerer <hi>Babylon,</hi> but beeauſe they are all but one (and uſing onely divers Synonima's which ſhews not the difference but largenes of them) there is none of them elder or yonger then other.</p>

                  <p>And thus have I done, Courteous Reader, about this, the moſt excellent, ancient, primitive and Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther tongue of all the World.

Nay becauſe I am not able to ſpeak fully enough about the uſefullneſſe of this Orientall tongue, I will here ſet downe a part of the very words of our grave and judicious Miniſtry of <hi>London,</hi> in their petition to bee humbly preſented to the honorable Court of common counſell, ſubſcribed by the ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointment and in the name of the ſociety of Syon-Colledge, <hi>Ian.</hi> 12. 1647.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>That great and glorious appearance of our Lord Ieſus Chriſt in his Churches, by his ſpirit and power (ſo often foretold in the holy Scriptures) for the calling of the Jewes, which belong to the election of grace, and for bringing in the fulneſſe of the</hi> Gentiles, <hi>that all the Kingdomes of the Earth may become the Kingdomes of the Lord, and of his Chriſt, ſeemes to us, to be now comming upon the wing in the midſt of thoſe formidable concuſſions of all Nations, to make way for his glory, that the Earth may bee filled with knowledge of the Lord, as the waters over the Sea. As a</hi> preludium <hi>and preparative to this great worke, we obſerve, that generally other Kingdomes, Commonwealths, and Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties of eminency and honour begin to looke towards the ſtudy, and advancement of the Orientall Languages with greater care, than in former ages, as it were by a ſecret inſtinct and ſtrong impulſion, making ready to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive of that bleſſing and grace which wee cannot fully deſcribe yet confidently expect. Hence it is that not onely in</hi> Italy <hi>and</hi> Spaine, <hi>but in</hi> Germany, France, <hi>and</hi> Switzerland <hi>the</hi> Netherlands <hi>and other ſtates, the Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giſtrates
<pb n="92" facs="tcp:64385:58"/>are zealous promoters, and magnificent patrones of the Illuſtrious Profeſſors, and profesſion of thoſe tongues, with honorable maintenance at the publick charge. The too great defects of able and profitable Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſors of thoſe tongues in this Kingdome (except in the Vniverſities) the ſtrong apprehenſions of many men of the difficulties of attaining thoſe Languages, together with the ſmall ſucceſſe of the various attempts of ſundry Smat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terers in thoſe ſtudies (which have rendered them both obſcure and contemtible) do plainly declare the great necesſity of publick countenancing and advancing more apt and effectuall meanes, to facilitate and carry on ſo great a work. Manifold and ineſtimable are the benefits of it. Thereby ſhall induſtrious men ſee more clearely with their owne eyes the very minde of GOD in that ſame Tongue, wherein himſelfe uttered it, and bee not onely better ſetled in the truth of our owne Tranſlations, but able to underſtand thoſe ancient verſions of the holy Bible in thoſe learned Languages, and other Authors of worth and uſe, as alſo with greater advantage to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſe, and traffic with the</hi> Eaſtern <hi>Nations in their owne Languages, which marvelouſly winneth upon the Natives of any Kingdome, where ever Travailors or Merchants come. Beſides it will greatly propagate this kinde of learning, whereby not onely the preſent age, but our poſterity will be more capable of the ſpirituall ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantages of the</hi> Jewes <hi>converſion, if not to contribute to it.</hi> So faire that paſſage of the Reverend Divines, My very much honoured, eſteemed and beloved brethren and Friends.</p>
                  <p>I will adde only one word concerning <hi>Arabic, viz.</hi> becauſe it is the ſame tongue with <hi>Ebrew,</hi> I deſire my curteous Reader to lay aſide all ill opinions and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>concept fancies concerning this tongue, becauſe it is the tongue of the <hi>Turcks.</hi> For it is not their true and naturall tongue but (as they deſcend from the

                     <hi>Tatars</hi>) they have the <hi>Tatar</hi> for their Mother tongue but becauſe the grand Signiour or Emperours govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment ſpreads over <hi>Syria, Arabia, Egypt,</hi> and all the <hi>Mediterranian</hi> Sea-ſhore of <hi>Aſia</hi> and <hi>Africa,</hi> (except onely <hi>Aſia</hi> the leſſe) ſpeake the <hi>Arabic</hi> tongue and are for the moſt part <hi>Muhammedans,</hi> knowne to us by that generall name of <hi>Turks.</hi> Let us not ſcorne this tongue but rather rejoyce that wee have ſuch a conſiderable progreſſe of it (not onely under the name of <hi>Arabic</hi>) diligently advanced not onely by <hi>Germanes, French, Italians,</hi> and Low <hi>Duchmen,</hi> but even by <hi>Engliſhmen</hi> themſelves, partly by ſetting up par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular profeſſors for this tongue in both Univerſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties <hi>Oxford</hi> and <hi>Cambridge,</hi> the latter being hono<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rably upheld by that renowned Citizen, And right Worſhipfull, Alderman <hi>Adams,</hi> late <hi>Lord Major</hi> of <hi>London</hi> my eſpecially reſpected and beloved patron and Friend; partly by giving and beſtowing an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finite treaſure of this kind of Manuſcripts upon both Univerſities, lately by the Parliament; and by that worthy and Honorable Knight Sir <hi>Thomas Wroth,</hi> unto the Library of Sion Colledge here in <hi>London,</hi> partly by elaborating moſt gallant bookes in this kinde, partly by the dilligent ſtudying of this juditi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous Nation in them. Let therefore the <hi>Arabic</hi> tongue be commended unto thee, as that wherein lies hid, greater profit then in all <hi>Greek</hi> and <hi>Roman</hi> antiquities. yea as far as piety hath a greater reward then worldly wiſdome.</p>
                  <p>I would I might now prove a true Prophet in this, that God hath left all the innermoſt parts of <hi>Africa,</hi> unknowne unto us, and us unto them, that when we come unto them, it may be with the <hi>Arabic</hi> printed bible in our hands, thereby to call them to the church of God. <hi>England, England,</hi> would to God thou knew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt the things that belong unto thy peace, but now

An infinite treaſure is not neceſſary to bring this to paſſe, one weekes revenews of the exciſe would do it. Nay let but thoſe gifts (dedicated unto pious uſes) be rightly beſtowed, and there would be no need of a new ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply. All the ports of <hi>Africa,</hi> and <hi>Aſia</hi> will admit you with the <hi>Arabic</hi> bible. And if yee had thouſands thereof, <hi>Turkes, Iewes</hi> and <hi>Chriſtians</hi> would buy them of you in <hi>Aſia</hi> and <hi>Africa,</hi> if you would but go unto thoſe parts where the grand Signor of <hi>Conſtantinople</hi> hath not ſo great authority, or elſe to the <hi>Ethiopians</hi> (who are Chriſtians like us) and ſo from behind the <hi>Muhammedans</hi> bring in their printed Bookes.</p>

                     <hi>A Generall Grammer for</hi> Ebrew, Samaritan, Calde, Syriac, Arabic, <hi>and</hi> Etiopic.</head>
                  <p>RULE I.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>
                        <seg rend="decorInit">A</seg>S other Tongues may bee written for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards or backwards, that is towards the right or left hand, ſo this.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Therefore <hi>Ebrew, Samaritic, Syriac</hi> and <hi>Arabic</hi> is written towards the left, <hi>Ethiopic</hi> towards the right hand, like Greeke, and Latine, and all other European tongues, deſcending from this primitive.</p>
                  <p>Rule II. <hi>As other Tongues, ſo this writes the Letters a part, or joynes them.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The Iewes as they write any tongue with their let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters, ſo did they the bible and other bookes of note with Letters a part, (as we do in printing) yet in their common writings (doubtleſſe) they did (as we doe for celerity ſake) joyne their Letters. And that by a threefold argument, 1. Becauſe it is naturall to all people to write faſt, and ioyning the caracters is the onely way. 2. The heathens contradiſtinct to the Jewes of that Country, <hi>viz.</hi> the <hi>Syrians</hi> being Chriſtians,
<pb n="100" facs="tcp:64385:65"/>and <hi>Arabians</hi> for the moſt part <hi>Muhammedans,</hi> doe write the Letters joyntly, as other Countries do, when they would write faſt. And no doubt, it is the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon courſe of that Country as well as it is of ours. Onely ſome few Letters they joyne not, (<hi>viz.</hi> The <hi>Syrians</hi> a, d, e, u, tz, r, t, or Olaf, dolat, He, Vau, Tzode, Ris, and Taw. The <hi>Arabians,</hi> a, d, w, z, &amp; r, or Elif, Del, (Dſel) vaw, zayin, ra.) with any following Letter, but with the foregoing they are as well as any other. <gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>. a, &amp; l, or Aleph, and Lamed are found joyned in one figure by the Jewes.</p>
                  <p>The <hi>Etiopians</hi> do write every Letter apart like the Jewes, which I thinke is done by them onely in ſome bookes of note as the bible, and all Church-books, yet in common writings I doubt not but that they joyne them as well as wee. Otherwiſe they may be thought to want the common ſence in writing. I deſire that this may be enquired after, and being found by experience to be ſo, that <hi>Europe</hi> may be acquainted with it.</p>
                  <p>Rule. 3. <hi>The eſſentiall duct (or ſtroak) of the Letters in this whole primitiue Tongue is one and the ſame.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Ebrew</hi> and <hi>Calde</hi> Letters are the very ſame, for there are no <hi>Caldeans</hi> extant, but the <hi>Iewes</hi> (ſince the <hi>Babilonian</hi> captivity) who gave unto that forme of writing and pronunciation (which they learnt there) the name of <hi>Calde;</hi> notwithſtanding they lived in Jeruſalem and the reſt of the holy Land. The <hi>Iewes</hi> uſe theſe <hi>murabba</hi> or <hi>ſquare Letters</hi> which they call <hi>Calde</hi> in any tongue whatſoever, as in <hi>Italian, Spaniſh, German, French, Perſian, Arabic, Turkiſh, Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lonian,</hi> or <hi>Muſcouian</hi> tongues.</p>
                  <p>The <hi>Samaritan</hi> are the old <hi>Ebrew</hi> Letters, uſed by the <hi>Jewes</hi> before the <hi>Babilonian</hi> captivity. My reaſon is this, <hi>Firſt,</hi> becauſe they are leſſe poliſhed more crooked, unproportionable, uneven and illfavou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red,
<pb n="101" facs="tcp:64385:65"/>then the common <hi>Ebrew</hi> now in uſe. For as the <hi>Jewes</hi> (before the captivity) were leſſe civilized, more proud, ſtifnecked, rebellious, untractable, and hardhearted, not onely to ſtrangers but to themſelves alſo: (as appeares by the generall complaint of the Prophets) ſo (after that affliction of 70 yeares capti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vity) they became more meeke, humble, patient, and tractable: and in that time finding that the <hi>Caldeans</hi> had the ſame Language, in eſſence, with them, and that their writing was more neate and comely then their own (by how much thoſe were a better govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed and policy'd people then they) they began not onely to learne, but affect, and that ſo well that they left their owne, crooked, and illfavoured Character unto thoſe <hi>Samaritans,</hi> (which they called Cuttims, becauſe deſcending from <hi>Cuthaya,</hi> or <hi>Scythia,</hi>) out of an hatred of their worſhip, and religion, and love of their owne religion, and new learned Character, which they found to bee more eaſy and neate than their old. <hi>Secondly,</hi> becauſe it is the common courſe of all Nations to mend the faſhion of their writing, as the <hi>Germans, Low-duch, Polonions,</hi> and <hi>Engliſh</hi> them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves have done, and do yet dayly.</p>
                  <p>The <hi>Syrian</hi> Characters are the ſame formerly uſed in <hi>Syria, Cnaan, Fliſtea,</hi> or <hi>Paleſtina,</hi> by the Heathens or Chriſtians, not the Jewes, and thence it is that the greateſt difference betwixt <hi>Calde</hi> and <hi>Syriac</hi> is only in the characters, the tongue being the ſame called <hi>Calde,</hi> when the Jewes ſpeake it, and <hi>Syriac</hi> when the Chriſtians. Now wee know well enough, that religion doth not change the tongue, as when popery was caſt out of <hi>England,</hi> the tongue did remaine the ſame. And thoſe petty differences betweene <hi>Calde</hi> and <hi>Syriac</hi> taught by <hi>Emira, Ecchellenſis, Waſerus, Maſius, Crineſius,</hi> de <hi>Dieu,</hi> and others following them, ſhall all be cleared up, and taken away in their pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per,
<pb n="102" facs="tcp:64385:66"/>place. Neither do they write downewards (as <hi>Maſius</hi> &amp;c. affirme) but onely ſome men for their more perfect and accurate writing, turne firſt their paper downeward, then make they that baſis or fundamentall ſtrooke, whereby the characters are joyned, down<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward, and ſo write the body of the Letters all a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>long upon it; which fully done, they turne againe upwards; Nor do they uſe many different faſhions of their writings about the lines, but write line for line as wee do. And there are many thouſands that do not turne their paper and yet write as faire and ſwift as the other. And this I have obſerved my ſelfe by many that have reſolved mee that queſtion; The o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther <hi>Syriac Eſtrangelo Letters</hi> are alſo the ſame, but onely that they are leſſe poliſhed as being more an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient.</p>
                  <p>The <hi>Arabians</hi> as they have the ſame way of joy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning, ſo have they likewiſe the eſſentiall writing. The names (if fully written) would appeare to be, [1.] the ſame names, [2.] the ſame fort of Letters, [3.] the names to be taken out of the ſame tongue, and [4.] that their order ſhould be the ſame with <hi>Ebrew Samaritan, Calde,</hi> and the <hi>Syriac</hi> Alphabet. All the difference may eaſily bee ſhewen by degrees, going from <hi>Samaritan</hi> to the old <hi>Syriac,</hi> hence to the new <hi>Syriac</hi> of <hi>Troſtius</hi> his new Teſtament, or the bookes printed in <hi>Germany</hi> and <hi>Leyden</hi> by <hi>Erpenius,</hi> hence to that latter printed at <hi>Rome,</hi> given out by <hi>Gabriel Sionita,</hi> or by that <hi>Syriac</hi> Old and New Teſtament lately given out by that ſame worthy and learned man at <hi>Paris.</hi> Hence to ſome farre better <hi>Syriac</hi> Manuſcripts extant in <hi>England,</hi> which being com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pared with the moſt ancient <hi>Arabic</hi> writing (as I have ſeene it at <hi>Epheſus</hi> in a table) that hangs there in a Church built by a <hi>Turck</hi> to the honour of <hi>Ieſus Chriſt</hi> called <hi>Iſa Peigamber;</hi> the characters thereof being
<pb n="103" facs="tcp:64385:66"/>like <hi>Syriac</hi>) you will finde them to be almoſt all one Nay among my own Manuſcripts, I have ſome pieces of <hi>Arabic</hi> witten upon Parchment being the <hi>Cufi.</hi> writing, which comes very neer unto the neateſt <hi>Syriac</hi> extant. There are here in <hi>England</hi> above 20000 ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verall faſhions of <hi>Arabic</hi> writings, every Manuſcript being different from other, and ſome of them being compoſed of ſeverall tracts, bound up together will afford 10, 20, nay 30, ſeverall formes of writing. And I my ſelfe have one Manuſcript that containes above an hundred different ſorts. Wherefore you muſt not ſtand either upon this or that print, for even as we our ſelves differ in writing ſo do they. And therefore I deſire you to acquaint your ſelves with the written bookes as much as poſſible. Nay there are ſome coppy bookes publiſhed in ſundry coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tries, wherein (that they might bee thought to bee skillfull in ſtrange tongues) they have made ſuch ſoul worke about the <hi>Syriac, Arabic, Turkiſh, Perſian, Malayan, Tatar,</hi> and <hi>Mogull</hi> Letters that I am aſhamed of them. Nay among printed bookes onely <hi>France</hi> and <hi>Italy</hi> have good <hi>Arabic</hi> characters, thoſe in <hi>Ger<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>many,</hi> and the <hi>Low countries</hi> are not good. Nor are <hi>Erpenius</hi> his characters according to the true and neat <hi>Arabic</hi> duct in writing. Nor are thoſe <hi>Arabick</hi> pieces cut in copper, in the deceaſed <hi>Crineſius</hi> his booke called <hi>Babel,</hi> or <hi>Joh. Zechendorfius</hi> yet living; (both <hi>Germans</hi>) well performed. But I hope wee ſhall ſhort<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly make neater worke in that kinde here in <hi>England</hi> then hath beene done hitherto in <hi>Europe.</hi>

And becauſe that ſome of the Aeolians and old Latines did pronounce g as the French do, je, ge, hence is it, that they miſtaking the ſecond degree of s (done onely by the tongue and the teeth) which is, the tongue not comming at the teeth, as the teeth cloſed, and the palat made with a cavity, make <hi>z</hi> a <hi>g,</hi> as the French ge and je.

Firſt, becauſe it is a pronunciation of non ſenſe, uſed by no people 2. Becauſe the Arabians, and Syrians, and Ethiopi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans do pronounce it only deep out of the throat. 3. the Latin could not pronounce it. 4. Gn is a compound ſound of g and n; but all the alfabet letters are of a ſingle ſound 5. it makes a confuſion of two inſtiuments of our ſpeech, the palate and tongue, as if theſe two made up the throat, when theſe two are different parts of our mouth as between themſelves, ſo alſo with the throat. It is therefore the ſureſt way for us, to leave it out wholy in our pronunciation.</p>

                  </p>
                  <p>The <hi>Arabians</hi> have formerly changed this order, which is clearly of divine authority and evident unto any one that lookes upon the 25.34.37.112.119 and 145 <hi>Pſalmes</hi> together with the firſt Chapter of the <hi>Lamentation</hi> of <hi>Jeremy,</hi> where alwayes is obſerved one and the ſame order, never changed or altered. Now this holy tongue being given by God Almighty
<pb n="168" facs="tcp:64385:73"/>to <hi>Adam,</hi> and being retained till <hi>David,</hi> and 450 years further till <hi>Ieremy,</hi> ſhould not that make us conſider, that as God orders all things wiſely, ſo truely there is Gods wiſdome in this order alſo. But mankinde is ſo blinde, that thouſands cannot ſee, what eaſily is ſeene by others, thouſands thinke themſelves to ſee ſomething, which others perceive to be nothing at all, ſome ſeeing to much, others, to little. Yet if they ſee with reaſon, notwithſtanding eſteemed to ſee to much, ſee and looke more truly into things, than thoſe that will not uſe the eyes of their minde, or reaſen. And further, becauſe that the conſonants in this tongue make the root, and give them the ſigni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication, it is cleare, that the conſonants have to ſigni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fie things, and conſonants following according to Gods order, here is, no doubt, a ſecret connexion of thoſe things, which either the conſonants, (before they come into the root,) do ſignifie or their names im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port. A thing neceſſary to be ſtudied, inquired, deeply ſearched, and in many hundert places eaſily obſervable, by hundreds obſerved, and formerly in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired.</p>
                  <p>Yet it is cleare and evident, that the <hi>Arabians</hi> of old had the very ſame order of the conſonants with <hi>Ebrue, Samaritic, Calde,</hi> and <hi>Syriac,</hi> becauſe the ſame letters with <hi>Arabic</hi> do ſignifie the ſame number with the <hi>Ebrue</hi> letter. Which numbring ariſes from their order; And the numbring being the ſame, the order is the ſame. Notwithſtanding this divine order, ſome <hi>Arabic</hi> Grammers, and Maſters of their Schooles and children ignorant of Gods Word in the old Teſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment not looking upon this order as a divine thing, did change their Alfabeticall order according to the changement of their figure, and brought <hi>b</hi> and <hi>t</hi> to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether, <hi>g</hi> and <hi>kh, r</hi> and <hi>z, ſhin</hi> or <hi>ſamek</hi> and <hi>ſin</hi> (<hi>ſh</hi> or or <hi>x</hi> and <hi>s</hi>) <hi>f</hi> and <hi>q ;</hi> yet did retaine ſome ſmall re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mainders

The writing of their bookes being very chargeable, they performe it with as great diligency, as formerly the Monkes did among us, whereof wee have at this very day many great, precious, and beautifull remainders in publick, and glorious libraries of private Gentlemen. Hence it is, that the letters are dilated or contracted, are
<pb n="116" facs="tcp:64385:74"/>longer or ſhorter, are of many and different formes even as among us every one writes diverſly: And yet if the line be filled, they write the reſt in the margent, parallell with the line, or write it above the laſt word or ſyllable: ſcarce ever breake the word ſo, as to put the reſt in the following line.</p>

                  <p>It is not in this tongue as it ſeemes to be in ours, where many hundrets of words begin with the vowell, not with the conſonant: ſo that if any ſillable in this tongue be heard to begin with <hi>a, e, i, o, u,</hi> you muſt ſtill imagine an <hi>alif</hi> or <hi>ayin</hi> to be before that vowell. And yet, if yee rightly ſcanne our <hi>Engliſh, Latine</hi> and <hi>Greec</hi> Alfaber, it is in our tongues as in theirs, in theirs, as in ours, becauſe that notwithſtanding ſome of our Alfabet, <hi>viz. a e, i, o, u,</hi> being true conſonants (which appeares out of this primitife tongue, from whence our Alfabet ariſes) yet are they taken to be vowells, even ſo in this primitife tongue, theſe ſix <gap reason="foreign">

                     <hi>a, e, i, o, u,</hi> and <hi>y,</hi> notwithſtanding that they are true conſonants yet many times they are eſteemed in place of vowels, and therefore cald <hi>matres lectionis,</hi> to read by them.</p>
                  <p>Rule 11. <hi>The alfabet is divided into letters of the throat, lip, palate, teeth and tongue.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>And this diviſion as it holds in all tongues of the World, ſo here in this whole tongue, not that the teeth and tongue letters are formed by the teeth and tongue only, as the throat, lip and palate letters are by them, which 12. letters the <hi>Arabic</hi> Grammarians aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cribe to the Moone, but the tongue is the chiefeſt inſtrument with the teeth in the tongue letters, as the teeth the chiefeſt inſtrument with the tongue in the teeth letters: which tongue and teeth letters are by the <hi>Arabic</hi> Grammarians aſcribed unto the Sunne.
<pb n="117" facs="tcp:64385:74"/>Therefore <hi>alef, he, Khet, ayin</hi> are of the throat. <hi>bet, vav, mem, fe,</hi> are of the lip, <hi>gimel, yod, kaf, quf,</hi> are of the palat; <hi>zayin, ſhin</hi> or <hi>Shamek, Tzade, Res</hi> and <hi>ſin</hi> are of the teeth principally, beſides the tongue; and <hi>dalet, thet, lamed, nun,</hi> and <hi>tau</hi> are of the tongue principally, beſides the teeth.</p>
                  <p>Rule 12. <hi>The figure of the conſonants are for the moſt part a little changed at the end of a word.</hi>

                  <p>And thereby you may eaſily obſerve the end of every word almoſt, eſpecially in <hi>Arabic,</hi> where you have very many of letters written with ſome confi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent ſtrook at the end, more than in <hi>Syriac, Calde,</hi> and <hi>Ebrue,</hi> where there is onely five ſuch, <hi>kaf, mem, nun, fe, tzade.</hi> Beſides them in <hi>Arabic bêt, gimel, he, khet, yod, lamed, ſhin, ayin, quf, ſin, tau.</hi> Whereof we ſee, that the <hi>Jewes</hi> in the <hi>Ebrue, Samaritic,</hi> and <hi>Calde,</hi> the <hi>Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans</hi> in the <hi>Siriac</hi> and <hi>Ethiopic</hi> have had many more finall letters, than now are ſeene, nay in <hi>Samaritic</hi> and <hi>Etiopic</hi> as yet wee ſee none at all.

                     <p>IT is a great queſtion, and mightily debated by two learned men of this time, whether any of theſe pricks and ſtrooks, repreſenting the Vowels, Characte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſtics and Accents, were from the beginning of the uſe of the tongue, and ſo in the <hi>Ebrue</hi> Bibel a part of Gods Word and tongue, without which almoſt no place in Scripture could be rightly underſtood or no, I deny them to be <hi>coaeva conſonis,</hi> to have bin written by <hi>Moſes</hi> the holy pen-Man of the Law, and punctu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally fet unto the conſonants, as wee now ſee them printed; nor the reſt of the books where by any au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thour of theirs ſo ill and ſilly handled, as to have caſt ſo many unneceſſary, idle, unreaſonable, ſuperfluous, uſeleſſe fancies upon them. I confeſſe, wee cannot punctually ſet downe the time, place, method, authors, and other circumſtances of theſe pricks, ſtroaks and crooked knots, there creeping in in all writings ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny things, whereof the year, authors, place and rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon was never ſet downe. Yet the chiefeſt reaſon,
<pb n="120" facs="tcp:64385:76"/>(for here I would have nothing ſimply rejected with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out grave reaſons) is, becauſe if they were eſſentiall to this tongue, then would they be conſtantly the ſame in <hi>Ebrew, Samaritic, Calde</hi> and <hi>Syriac, Arabic</hi> and <hi>Etiopic.</hi> I beſeech the Reader to conſider, 1. that it is as old a faſhion to have Bibles without pricks as with prics, and in my apprehenſion, older to; yet here I do ſpeake onely of a time of 1300 yeares or thereabout. If we confeſſe, <hi>Hierome</hi> to make men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion now and then of points, yet we ſee alſo, that there is a great quantity of places otherwiſe rendred by him, or at leaſt, the proper names otherwiſe read, than now the prics will ſuffer. And though <hi>Zoar</hi> (that very old Rabbinicall book) makes mention of the Names of the Vowells, who will not confeſſe, that thoſe names might be very eaſily written by ſome other in ſome copy of <hi>Zoar,</hi> which either by tranſcription, or im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſion is now in the Text. Have we not thouſands of ſuch incroachings upon the Text in hunderts of Authors. But if that were not ſo, and that ſome of them were named, doth it therefore follow that they have bin all at that time? If the <hi>Grecians</hi> could be content with <hi>a, e, o,</hi> for vowells, as <hi>Plato</hi> ſayes, and the <hi>Arabians</hi> had nor have any more, but theſe three from <hi>Platês</hi> time till this very day: and if the <hi>Sirians</hi> could be content without vowells, till they becom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming Chriſtians, and tranſlating many books out of Greec in their tongue, did in proper names firſt, after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards alſo in other Nounes &amp; Verbs aſſume the Greec <hi>a, e, i, o, u,</hi> and if the <hi>Perſians, Turcs, Tatars</hi> great and lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle all <hi>Mogull</hi> and <hi>Malaye</hi> could be content from their very beginning till this day to bee without prics in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtead of Vowels, what thinke you was there then a curſe of God upon the Jewes and all the Prophets, that they could nor would underſtand the writing of one another without ſo many ſuperfluities. Is <hi>a, e, i, o, u, y,</hi>
                        <pb n="121" facs="tcp:64385:76"/>enough for us in all occident to read by, and is not <gap reason="foreign">

                        </gap> enough to do the ſame, when theſe do as well repreſent Conſonants and Vowells as thoſe do. And what a malediction will you caſt upon Gods Word, that when many hundreds can underſtand, and that without any heſitation at all, thouſands of other books without theſe prics, they ſhould not be able to underſtand Gods Booke without ſuch a doe. If that Word of God were written with all that infinity of pricking and ſtroaking every line and letter, were it not the greateſt injury that could be done to it, to have it once printed without them? How thinke yee would the <hi>Iewes</hi> once dare to offer ſuch an unexpreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſable ſacriledge? Or by what meanes are the <hi>Jewes</hi> wiſer, then God himſelfe, who could not finde out an eaſy way for his Word to be read and fully under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtood, till the <hi>Jewes</hi> found it out? Why muſt onely the <hi>Jewes</hi> have 15 Vowells, and 20 or 30 Accents, but no characteriſticall points betweene a Verbe and a Noun, the ſecond and the third perſon, active and paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſive, as the <hi>Syrians</hi> are ſaid to have? What a ſtrange thing is it, that the <hi>Sirians</hi> have never a <hi>ſva,</hi> never a <hi>dages forte</hi> (as Emira and Ludoyic de Dien do rightly affirme) that there ſhould never be found any <hi>dages lene</hi> in Arabic, but all <hi>dages forte,</hi> and contrary, no <hi>forte</hi> but all <hi>lene</hi> in Syriac. In Etiopic and Sama<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritic nothing; in Ebrew Bibles without poynts nor <hi>dages forte</hi> nor <hi>lene;</hi> Nay in the Samaritic the whole Law without Vowells and any pricks or ſtroaks of Accents. No Accents in Etiopic, Arabic and Syriac, no Accents in any other Ebrue booke, nor in my Cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>de Manuſcript, being Queſtions and Anſwers upon the Law. No Accents nor Vowells in the Arabic and Syriac old Teſtament given out in the King of France his Bible, untill added by <hi>Gabriel Siouite,</hi> as he pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lickly confeſſes. And whence that infinity of ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>malies
<pb n="122" facs="tcp:64385:77"/>in Vowells, in Accents, and what an abſurdi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty is in all the Accents, not one onely except. What has <hi>atnakh</hi> the Duke to make a determination of 25 Verſes, otherwiſe to be done by <hi>Silluq</hi> the King, when He ſtands in hundert of places as a boy and ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vant, which nor the Text, nor reaſon regardes. What a boyes trick and childiſh punctation of <hi>atnakh</hi> is in the third word of the bible, <hi>In the beginning created God.</hi> Is it ſenſe or nonſenſe? And yet there muſt be the Duke <hi>Arnakh.</hi> Truely I pitty all thoſe great Man, that are become boyes and children, playing thus for the Vowels, Accents, and diacriticall Notes, that they write whole books about fancies, and childiſh ſtuffe, given over unto reprobate minds and labour without the bleſſing of God.</p>
                     <p>Rule 2. <hi>The Pricks, added unto Conſonant Vowells, inſtead of Vowells, are various, according to the fancy of the inventours in various Countries of the Orient.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>In <hi>Ebrue, Samaritic, Calde, Arabic,</hi> and <hi>Eticpic</hi> are there naturally none, becauſe ſuperfluous, the ſame letters by them being the true Vowels, <hi>a, e, t, o, u,</hi> which are uſed by us in Engliſh; look only to the table and obſerve their order. Yet with all according to the traditions of Grammarians of ſeveral dialects here will we ſpeak diſtinctly of every one of them ſeparatly.</p>

                        <p n="1">1. The ſounds <hi>a, e, i, o, u,</hi> are naturally in every lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guage, and therefore in this primitive tongue by all meanes. 2. Becauſe the ſound will bee heard more long, when it ſtands at the end of a ſyllable, as <hi>va, ve vi, vo, vu, ſva, ſve, ſvi, ſvo, ſvu;</hi> and ſhorter, when after that ſound followes a Conſonant, <hi>vas, ves, vis, vos, vus,</hi> therefore did ſome Jewes, Maſters of children, or Grammarians for their Diſciples ſake invent a double
<pb n="123" facs="tcp:64385:77"/>ſort of pricks for that double ſyllable, which I call long and ſhort, (as the Vowells are of late cald long and ſhort, otherwiſe cald great and little) <hi>viz.</hi> for the long ſyllable <hi>qumez, zeri, hireq, holem, ſureq.</hi> For the ſhort ſyllable; <hi>fatah, ſegol, hireq, qomez, qubbutz.</hi> 3. Thoſe that have but one name as <hi>qametz</hi> or <hi>qomets,</hi> and <hi>hireq,</hi> have alſo but one ſhape: which breeding a confuſion doth ſhew us the ſillineſſe of theſe Gram<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>marians (God being able to make better worke in his primitiſe tongue) that they were not able to invent two pricks more, thereby to prevent all confuſion, which hetherto lies as a plague upon thoſe, who will learne this Ebrue with theſe pricks, and not otherwiſe, and being almoſt impoſſible to overcome, caſts them of from Gods tongue. 4.

If you pronounce <hi>a</hi> or <hi>o</hi> ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to your pleaſure. 1. Becauſe the greateſt diſtin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction betweene the pronunciation of Ebrew and Ara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bic, Syriac and Ebrue, Syriac &amp; Arabick, is that the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer loves rather <hi>o,</hi> the latter <hi>a,</hi> where the Ebrew ſayes <hi>foqed,</hi> the Arabic ſayes <hi>faqed.</hi> 2.

The ſame change is in Calde, Syriac, Arabic and Etiopic, and that
<pb n="124" facs="tcp:64385:78"/>in the ſame words, which do ſo change in Ebrew, that the unity of this tongue is even in the unity of a vow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ell by this or that letter to be obſerved in thouſands of examples. 5. And becauſe in no language at all juſt every conſonant or letter hath its Vowell, and having none muſt go either to the forgoing or following letter which hath a Vowell; as: <hi>s|va, va|s;</hi> theſe Jewiſh Maſters thought it neceſſary now and then to prick ſuch letters, that had no vowell, yet not alwayes, with two pricks (:) which they juſtly called <hi>ſva</hi> (to wit <hi>troubles, falſhood, vanity, without need and reaſon, à lye,</hi> the Latines, <hi>fruſtra, gratis, mendacium, tumultus, fal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſum;</hi> the Greec LXX <gap reason="foreign">

                        <p n="2">II. That they make a diſtinction betweene a mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vable and a quieſcent.

They finde in the Greec LXX tranſlation in many names, (where now in the Ebrue Bible a letter hath no Vowell,) an <hi>a, e, i, o, u,</hi> which confounds againe that tenant, 3. Some alleadge divers Authors which held that opinion, that <hi>ſva</hi> was pronounced according to the following Vowell.

<pb n="125" facs="tcp:64385:78"/>written where any reaſonable man might obſerve; 1. That it is impoſſible that one and the ſame thing ſhould naturally both have and not have a ſound. And if they bring in the diſtinction of places, where it is ſounded, to wit, in all, where it is called movable, and of others where not; I anſwer. 1. That that diſtin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction is broken downe by many examples in Nounes and Verbs, where in place of the <hi>quieſcent</hi> as well as the movable is any Vowell <hi>a e i o u</hi> in the ſame pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per names pronounced and written. 1.

Yet in hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dreds of places, where Ebrue has a <hi>ſva quieſcent</hi> they put in any Vowell; whereof, being the ſelfe ſame tongue with Ebrue, and having in Ebrue it ſelfe fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently a Vowell, for the moſt part an <hi>I,</hi> men of reaſon ſhould conclude, that the punctation of the Jewes in the Ebrue Bible and Calde <hi>Targum</hi> is not authentick, it being ſo full of variations, incertitudes, confuſions, that hitherto there hath beene no end at all found in theſe things.</p>

And every letter with theſe five vowels, to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether with the ſixth ſtanding among the accidentall parts of the word, the vowels. Yet what abſtract precept properly to give to that ſixth ſtanding I know not for the great variation ſake.

The firſt part is again either of the ſimple and abſtract ſignification, <hi>viz. Etymology</hi> (that is the Lexicâs and Dictionaries, which handles the firſt more properly) where if poſſible. 1. The reaſon why this roote ſignifies this and not that ſhould be ſhewed, but hath bin hitherto neglected by them all. 2. That ſignification ſhould (according to Retoric, Logic, Fiſic, and Metafiſic) be diſtinguiſhed unto all its branches. 3. The diviſion (with the reaſon there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of) ſhould be clearly ſet downe. 4. The Authori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, as not ſuperfluous ſhould be added, that we might ſee it to bee truly humane, good, ſound and ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfactory reaſon: which all Authours hetherto want.

The firſt part conſiders the root, without any the leaſt conſideera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the parts of a ſpeech, unto how many parts of a ſpeech every root is dividable. The ſecond layes downe certaine rules, into how many parts all the words of this or that or any tongue may be di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vided, and than applies every word, or layes downe certaine rules, to which they may be applied.

Yet before wee come to <hi>Analogy</hi> wee will heare lay downe onely the precepts for the root according to the <hi>Letters,</hi> not <hi>ſignifications</hi> either of the <hi>root</hi> or <hi>words radicall</hi> or <hi>accidentall, proper</hi> or <hi>improper, firſt</hi> or <hi>ſecond, ideall</hi> or <hi>naturall, Metafiſicall</hi> or <hi>Fiſicall,</hi> which things ſhall bee laid downe in the <hi>Dictionary,</hi> which is, God willing to follow.</p>
                     <p>Rule. 2. <hi>All words, (none excepted) of this tongue may, nay muſt be brought to a certain root.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>As this tongue is the primitive from <hi>Adam</hi> the firſt man, and remayning yet till our dayes in all <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>frica</hi> and a great part of <hi>Aſia</hi> ſo is it the moſt ſimple (or if wee will call it) ſingle and accurate of any other tongue in the World, that I could ever yet attayne any skill in. The <hi>Greec</hi> Dictionary Writers, and after them the <hi>Latines</hi> did never lay down ſuch certaine Rules in their tongue (for the finding ſuch accurateneſſe) as this tongue hath. The remainders of <hi>Greec</hi> and <hi>Latine</hi> Authors (which two Nations are the moſt accurate writers (as in other things ſo a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout their tongue) of all other Nations, whatſoever) do ſhew that they did not ariſe to the hight of this perfection. For what out of this tongue may bee demonſtrated to bee a derivative, they tooke for
<pb n="150" facs="tcp:64385:91"/>a primitive; and a primitive, for a derivative. The title they had, but for the thing it ſelfe to bring to a right ſtay, ſo farre they never came. The benefit of this Rule will bee made manifeſt, when in the Dictionary certaine Rules will be laid down for the abſtract ſignification of the letters: the inquiſition and determination whereof doth onely belong to the Dictionaries. And truly without that principle of the inward and naturall ſignification, which every let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of the Alfabet (being as a naturall dowry beſtowed upon it by God) brings to the roote, I ſee not, why wee ſhould make any <hi>Analogy</hi> or Grammaticall rules at all, to bring every word to a root. For as the rules ſhew that ſo many words, (which otherwiſe would ſeeme not to be of one and the ſame family,) belong unto this or that one root, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>o is the root required for its naturall, ideall, and abſtract ſignification, different from any other what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever ſignification, becauſe proper to another root. And becauſe the root is required and that by all men, that ſhewes plainly and evidently, that in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed there is ſomething in the root, for which it is ſo ſought after and deſired, <hi>viz.</hi> The ſignification. And that denies none. But another queſtion and that more neceſſary and before others to be determined is, from whence this ſignification comes; If they ſay, from the people, that is falſe; for <hi>Adam</hi> alone in the World had the whole tongue and the ſignifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation of all roots. If <hi>ex impoſitione humanâ</hi> by <hi>Adams</hi> pleaſure; that is falſe, becauſe as <hi>Adam</hi> was not the orator of himſelfe, his reaſon, wit and tongue, whereby he ſpake to God, ſo neither did he invent the ſignifications of every root, hee being inabled by God Almighty with the conſequence the words themſelves, not <hi>a priori,</hi> to coyne roots, and from thence words, and then to ſpeak with his creator.
<pb n="151" facs="tcp:64385:91"/>So that this queſtion is almoſt <hi>Analogall</hi> to that in <hi>Fiſic,</hi> if the ſoule be <hi>ex traduce</hi> or <hi>per traducem.</hi> I de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termine it thus, that as nothing makes the root, but the letters, ſo nothing makes the ſignification of the root, but the ſignification of thoſe letters.</p>
                     <p>Rule 3 <hi>A root conſiſts of three conſonants, not of</hi> 2, 4, 5 <hi>or more, much leſſe of one only.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>This is the formall part, whereby this holy pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitive and orientall tongue (for perfection) excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leth all the tongues in the World, becauſe all the other are derived from this. It may be, that ſome learned men have ſtudied to find out ſeverall wayes, whereby to bring this or that tongue, which they did moſt affect, unto this or that more ancient, and for the moſt part unto this primitive tongue; and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore from hence they take a moſt cautious way to finde out firſt the root of every word in that tongue, and to bring many words to a moſt ſimle and ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtract way. Yet I am ſure and certaine, that no tongue in the World, but this hath ſuch an extra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ordinary, holy <hi>trinunity</hi> and <hi>unitrinity:</hi> as firſt, that every word (of how many letters ſoever, <hi>proper</hi> or <hi>accidentall, naturall</hi> or <hi>adjectitious</hi>) may, nay muſt be brought to certaine radicall letters. 2. That the leaſt as well as the biggeſt word hath its equall por<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion in the root, the leaſt not having fewer letters than three, nor the biggeſt any more. So that whatſoever lacks or aboundes, muſt neceſſarily be made up or detracted by certaine <hi>Etimoligy</hi> and Rules of <hi>Analogy.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>And this Rule is not now invented by mee, or a principle of my ſtampe, but the generality of Gram<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>marians in whatſoever dialect of this tongue give this very ſame Rule. And yet a man would wonder to behold the inconſtancy, ſloath, and irregularity partly of the Grammarians and partly of the Dicti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>onary
<pb n="152" facs="tcp:64385:92"/>or Lexica writers, who do not obſerve this their owne and all mens rule, as making no conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence to confound the art of this tongue, by not cloſly adhering to the principles of it, and thus them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves unlooſe that ty and knot, wherewith they profeſſed to keepe all roots in a ſtrict order, when by their practiſe it is obſervable, that they never intended any ſuch thing. And which is the worſt of all, none of the Lexicas extant are without that great fault. And ſo long as the Dictionaries are not brought (amongſt many other things yet lacking) to that ſtrict, obſervation of things propounded by the Grammar, (which is expected and preſuppoſed to lay downe no falfe precepts) there will never be that clearnes and eaiſineſſe of the tongue, as there would be if the art of the Grammar and the art of the dictionaries were brought to a greater perfecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on. I perſwade my ſelfe, that there are very few, that can believe mee: but it is no wonder, for igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance and prejudicated opinions are never able to judge well of any thing.</p>
                     <p>Rule. 4. <hi>Every root conſiſts of letters onely, not of letters and pricks joyned together.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>By this Rule all <hi>roots</hi> as alſo all <hi>letters</hi> none ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepted are included, and all <hi>pricks</hi> even excluded.</p>
                     <p>Whereby many queſtions are reſolved, which hetherto have troubled the braines of the learned. <hi>Firſt,</hi> it ſhewes, that there is a unity in the nature of roots whither in <hi>Ebrue, Calde, Samaritan, Syriac, Arabic</hi> or <hi>Etiopic;</hi> whereas if you aske a man ſkil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full in <hi>Ebrue</hi> (but not in the other dialects) what the nature of the roots in theſe dialectsare, he will doubt, not being able to give a determinate anſwer. Thus learned men make themſelves ſeeme to be un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>learned; and whereas I can make them more learn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, <hi>viz.</hi> by giving them a good and true notion,
<pb n="153" facs="tcp:64385:92"/>(whereby they may inlarge the uſe of their know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge, and that without their paines,) invented as I may terme it by my owne induſtry, and yet I know not whither I ſhall ever have thanks for it or not, ſure I am, hereafter it will do much good. <hi>Second<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,</hi> it is againſt thoſe tenents, that the root is either in the Noune or Verbe, and herein the moſt excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent men do diſagree: ſome will have it in the Noune, others in the Verbe, and by ſome againe it is at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tributed to the Noune in <hi>Siriac,</hi> others deny it, thus they ſtrive one againſt another, and that neither <hi>de lana caprina,</hi> of the Woole of a Goate, who has none, for whatſoever party hath the prerogative, will give Law unto others, and all the reſt, if there be more than two. And it is a great matter in a Kingdom, who ſwayes the Scepter, the Verbe being Soveraigne in <hi>Ebrue,</hi> will be ſo in <hi>Siriac,</hi> and yet <hi>Emira</hi> will have it by the Nounes. <hi>De Dieu</hi> thinkes the Verb hath it by the <hi>Syrians,</hi> and yet beginnes with the Noune. In this manner I could name a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove 300 men, the moſt whereof (I conſeſſe) do give the radicall dignity and ſoveraignty unto the verb, yet many unto the Noun. But they all faile herein; for the root is neither in the Verb, nor Noune, nor in any other part of ſpeech (if there weare any, as there are not, which I ſhall make more cleare hereafter) but abſolutly in the letters, though not conſidered as yet, if a Noune or Verbe; leſſe if active, paſſive, neuter, deponent, Maſculine, Feminine, ſingular, plu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall, preſent, preter or future, participle or pronoun, &amp;c. The reaſon for this aſſertion is, becauſe it contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicts the nature of a root, which is never the tree it ſelfe, the branches, the leaves, the bloſomes, the fruits, nor the tronke or body of the tree, but that part which lies under ground, and none of all theſe is cald the root, and is the firſt principle and cauſe
<pb n="154" facs="tcp:64385:93"/>of all theſe. <hi>Thirdly,</hi> it ſhewes that the letters onely, (and not joyned with the pricks,) make the root. The reaſon is plaine, for if it be pronounced by putting the vowells thereunto, it is no longer a root, but a Noune or Verbe; for the letters onely and not the pricks (eſteemed Vowels) are in the Alfabet, much leſſe the third ſingular in the pretertenſe, or the infinitive, or imperative or any Noune. And therefore it is a falſe aſſertion, to ſay, that becauſe the third perſon ſingular in pretertenſe is not found in the Bible, <hi>ergo</hi> the root is not extant in <hi>Ebrue, Calde, &amp;c.</hi> Whereas if there be but one forme found of any root whatſoever in any dialect, perſon, gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, number, declination, or conjugation, nay if but onely one radicall be extant, ſo that either the firſt or ſecond or third, firſt or third, or any two of them be caſt away, yet if there be but one radicall letter to bee found, ſo that by Grammar rules the two di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſſident may be recovered, the root is truly extant in this Orientall Tongue.</p>
                     <p>Thereby it is alſo cleare, that the diviſion of the letters (into radicall and ſervile) is falſe, becauſe all the letters are radicall, <hi>viz.</hi> They have all one and the ſame right, to make a root, not onely this but every one of them. Otherwiſe the Alfabet had not the ſame honour in the <hi>Etymology,</hi> which it hath in the <hi>Orthography.</hi> For as all letters are uſed in the reading, ſo all letters are uſed, in the conſtitution of any word: and than you might with all reaſon ſay, that theſe 11 Members of the Alfabet, <hi>viz. mſh v k l b a tyn</hi> 
                        <gap reason="foreign">
                           <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                        </gap> might be alſo queſtioned, whither they had any right at all in the pronouncia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion or not, if they have none in the conſtitution of the root. 3. Then would the practiſe of all the Lexicâs be falſe, who have roots not onely forthe firſt but alſo ſecond and third radicall, of euery let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
<pb n="155" facs="tcp:64385:93"/>of the Alfabet, none excluded. 4. There muſt then be given ſufficient reaſon, how it came, that thoſe 11 letters were not radicall, nay, why never radicall; which is impoſſible to give. But if yee ſay, the Grammarians do not conceave that they are ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver radicall, but alwayes ſervile, and the radicalls never ſervile but alwayes radicall. I anſwer; that I wiſh they would then ſpeake plainer and clearer; but when, I dare ſay, above an hundred Grammari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans make that diſtinction, that 11 are radicalls, and 11 ſervile, why ſhould I not believe them to ſpeake proper? Why doe they not then call all the <hi>letters</hi> radicall, and then give a diſtinction, which of thoſe are for the moſt part radicalls, though many times ſervile, and why do they never ſet downe, what ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſe thoſe 11 <hi>letters</hi> (by them called perpetuall radicals) do performe, when they are now and then found in the <hi>Ebrue</hi> Bible not to bee radicall? As if it were not as eaſy to ſpeake proper and plaine, as well in the Rule, as in the explication of the Rule.</p>

                     <p>As theſe three <hi>letters</hi> in the Alfabet are oppoſite to all the other 19 <hi>letters</hi> in <hi>Orthography,</hi> and ſtand onely as one man, repreſenting the five Vowels, ſo here in <hi>Etymology,</hi> they doe ſtand as one man too, and repreſent but one letter, not three. And that by theſe following arguments. 1. You ſee no practice in any Grammar of any of theſe dialects to the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary, but you may finde a multitude of examples in every one, and out of many, many thouſands; not only in the permutation of the <hi>radicall letters,</hi> but even, when they are but <hi>ſervile,</hi> and do ſtand to wait upon <hi>radicals</hi> in any reſpect whatſoever of
<pb n="156" facs="tcp:64385:94"/>place, part of the word or ſpeech. Open but any Grammer (if yee have skill to underſtand its pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepts) and yee will finde it. And yet of all thoſe Grammarians there is not one, that ſayes they are but one <hi>letter</hi> in reſpect of <hi>Etymology.</hi> 2. It is the practiſe in all Dictionary and Lexicâs of whatſoever dialect of this tongue: that in truth I pity all the Authors of Dixionaries, not one excepted, that out of ſo many examples they could not ſee ſo much. 3, That this rule doth ſhew in a very great meaſure, that all the dialects of this tongue, none excluded, have one and the ſame nature with each other; if not in other things, (which hereafter will bee ſeene,) yet in this particular. 4. Becauſe all the Authors ſpeake of that changement of the <hi>quieſcents,</hi> onely I reduce them, 1. From foure unto three, and 2. Unto a unity, not a Trinity.</p>
                     <p>Now whereas it might be objected, that in <hi>Ebrue</hi> and <hi>Calde</hi> there were <hi>foure</hi> not <hi>three,</hi> and in the reſt <hi>three,</hi> and that even this diverſity of: the number of theſe do ſhew the diverſity of the nature of the <hi>dialect,</hi> and therefore no unity; I anſwer.</p>

Here it is enough to obſerve that any kinde of word whatſoever, none excepted, comes from a root, ſeeing that the root it ſelfe never ſtands in any booke, as the root, but the words deſcending from the roots. This firſt rule of <hi>Analogy</hi> ſhewes us likewiſe, by what liberty, and yet with a regularity, words may be multiplied, to wit, (as wee ſay in La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tine and Greec, <hi>Analogicè,</hi>) according to <hi>analogy,</hi> the right whereof is to forme words in a decent way; For otherwiſe if there were not ſuch lawfulneſſe, then wee might never make bold to forme any new word in this orientall primitive tongue, where wee had none before. As for inſtance. In <hi>Ebrue</hi> I may make a verbe of any perſon and tenſe, although wee have it not in the <hi>Ebrue</hi> Bible.

                     <p>IN the <hi>Orthography</hi> it is told us, that there are two conditions, that you muſt rely upon (in <hi>Ebrue, Calde</hi> and <hi>Arabic</hi>) to ſee the Dages or Teſhdid expreſſed. 1. That the former ſyllable end upon a Vowell. 2. That the letter which is to have <hi>Dages</hi> or <hi>Teſhîd</hi> have a vowell, or go to the following letter with a Vowell. If any of thoſe two conditions faile there is no Dages or Teſhdid to be expected, and if it be there, it wants almoſt all its vertue and power. Yet yee muſt not expect to finde this <hi>Dages</hi> conſtantly in any Manuſcripts without pricks, and yet you will finde it in ſome places of thoſe Manuſcripts that are written with the leaſt care. And therefore it muſt be denyed to the <hi>Samaritic, Syriac,</hi> and <hi>Etiopic</hi> in ſome meaſure, becauſe they have not written it, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept in <hi>Syriac</hi> now and then, and in ſome meaſure yee muſt confeſſe it to be not onely in <hi>Syriac</hi> (for if it bee but once written in the booke, it is enough to demonſtrate that it is extant;) but alſo in <hi>Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maritic</hi> and <hi>Etiopic</hi> to. Whereſoever you finde it in <hi>Ebrue, Calde</hi> and <hi>Arabic,</hi> you will either finde it (or elſe muſt underſtand it to be) in <hi>Syriac, Sama<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritic</hi> and <hi>Etiopic.</hi> The profit of this Rule is; that it takes away all theſe <hi>anomalicall</hi> examples, in <hi>Ebrue

                     </p>
                     <p>This Rule is by all Grammarians given in <hi>Ortho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>graphy,</hi> where it is not proper. For I would onely know of them whither a beginner bee able to reade <hi>Ebrue,</hi> &amp;c. without this diſtinction; or whither he muſt needs know it? I am ſure hee may read <hi>Ebrue, Calde Syriac</hi> and <hi>Arabic</hi> without it. And why than muſt it bee put there, where nothing is taught, but onely that which belongs to reading. Tell the beginner, that <hi>Dages</hi> and <hi>Teſhdid</hi> double the letter, and thou haſt done all that is needfull in <hi>Orthography.</hi> But as for <hi>Analogy,</hi> here theſe differences, (if there bee any) which expreſſe the inward nature of it, are to be ſet downe. And for that purpoſe, the Gram<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>marians have allowed unto <hi>Ebrue</hi> and <hi>Calde,</hi> a <hi>com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penſative,</hi> a <hi>characteriſtic</hi> and an <hi>Euphonic,</hi> where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>unto <hi>R.

                        <p>OF the ſeven Orders of the Verbs and Nounes I have ſpoken before. Theſe ſeven Orders become ſo many rather by the pricks, than conſonants, or letters.

By this multiplication of the Vowell under the ſecond radicall is taken away many hundred <hi>anomalicall obſervations</hi> extant by <hi>Buxtorf,</hi> and the greateſt part of the Grammarians, who ſetting only <hi>fatah,</hi> the examples of <hi>zere</hi> and <hi>Holem</hi> muſt neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſarily become <hi>anomalies.</hi> The ſame holdes in the <hi>future,</hi> and in the <hi>pretertenſe,</hi> ſo long as the accent is at that ſecond radicall. So is it than, that the <hi>firſt</hi> and <hi>third Radicall</hi> for the moſt part hath not a vowel nor accent. The ſame variation of the ſecond radicall, doth hold in the <hi>firſt</hi> and <hi>third,</hi> if it receaves
<pb n="204" facs="tcp:64385:118"/>a Vowell: the variation thereof will bee generally under any letter whatſoever, yet which Vowels are the moſt frequent in the Ebrue Bible, you ſee out of the <hi>Paradigme.</hi> Onely you muſt remember that this extends onely unto Ebrue, not to <hi>Calde, Syriac, Etiopic</hi> and <hi>Arabic.</hi> For in theſe dialects the chang<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings and variations are a great deale leſſe frequent, then in <hi>Ebrue;</hi> as for inſtance, that the letter hath never a <hi>ſva movable,</hi> but alwayes a Vowell: that the letter hath neither conſtantly a <hi>gezm</hi> or <hi>ſva quieſcent,</hi> but in many places in ſteed of that, a Vowell. So that all theſe petty obſervations, which <hi>Buxtorf</hi> and the reſt have in a great quantity, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning the Vowels (not the letters) and accents, are not conſiderable.

Martinius Ebru Gram<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mar Engliſhed, Printed at Amſterdam twice, both Anno</hi> 1645. <hi>and</hi> 1646. <hi>Item in my Latine Deline a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the Ebrue Grammar Printed at Amſterdam in</hi> 4<hi rend="sup">o</hi> 1646. page 80.</p>
                        <p>Rule 11. <hi>The accents are ſuppoſed to joyne and diſjoyne words for the making up a true and right ſenſe.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>Before I have fully done about theſe accents, there is as yet one uſe of them remaining to be handled, which is aſſigned unto them by all the Grammarians that have written hitherto, to wit, that they have the power of a Syntacticall combination of words, and diſjunctions of them, that is, to ſhew which words are to be joyned together to make up a plaine ſenſe ſuch as is intended by the Holy Ghoſt in every
<pb n="241" facs="tcp:64385:136"/>place, &amp; in every verſe of the Bible, whereon alſo for the moſt part depends diſtinction of verſes, which according to the beſt obſervation of mine and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers upon ſuch a ſuppoſall (notwithſtanding I am not of the mind that it is truely in them, So that I doe diſclaime here what formerly I have precepti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cally ſet down either in my Engliſh or Latine Books concerning it, yet if ſome men will ſtand to it, be it right or wrong I will ſhortly repeale it here) is as followeth.</p>
                        <p n="1">1. That they are the accidentall ſigne of a Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>junction or disjunction of words. 2 That they ſigni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fie; firſt, a greater or fuller point; ſecondly, a leſſer point; thirdly, two little points; fourthly, a little point with a Comma; fiftly, the ſtroke Comma; ſixtly, yet they never ſhew where there is an excla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation or interogation, neither which words toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther belong to a comma, comma with a point, two little points, the leſſe and the greater or full point. 3. All this in a naturall order, where a ſence is full ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther of one word, or of two joynd, or of three, whereof the two firſt or laſt be more neerely joyned, yet in reſpect to the third or fourth words, where al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo the two or three former or latter more neerely to be joyned with relation to the body of fewer or of many more with none greater, or greater diſtincti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on; now by reaſon theſe five degrees of diſtinctions which are in all manner of ſpeech in any tongue whatſoever uſed here in the occident and the North, though not in the whole Orient. 4 The accents are of five degrees thus call d by the Grammarians. 1 One King, <hi>Silluq.</hi> 2 Dukes, <hi>Atnah,</hi> and compound <hi>merca.</hi> 3 Earles, <hi>zaqef, ſgolta,</hi> and <hi>tifha.</hi> 4 Lords, <hi>ſalſelet, rbia</hi> ſingle or compound with a <hi>ſilluq, ſaſta, zarqa, tbir,</hi> a double <hi>merca, ytib,</hi> five Knights, <hi>fazr, qarne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>farah, t liſa geres.</hi> 5 Theſe make up whole ſenſes ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording
<pb n="242" facs="tcp:64385:137"/>to thoſe five degrees of ſenſes. 6 The reſt are called <hi>ſervants,</hi> becauſe they onely joyne words, two three or foure, to bring them to the following Knight, Lord, Earle, Duke or King, to make up the full ſenſe. 7 Every one of theſe according to his de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree makes a greater or leſſer joynr, and hath before him firſt a great diſtinguiſher: ſecondly, a leſſer, (but Knights have none of both before them;) thirdly, a joyner, each with his ſervants of a greater or leſſer di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinguiſher before him: &amp; finally followes the fourth, the King. 8 Yet whereas in the whole Bible there is almoſt one and the ſame order obſerved) three bookes, <hi>viz. Job,</hi> the <hi>Proverbs,</hi> and the <hi>Pſalmes</hi> have no Earles, and doe differ in ſome ſmall matter beſides, as to the following fiame. 9 They are gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally in the Bible thus.</p>
